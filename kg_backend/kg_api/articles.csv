2024-10-25 18:40:09,"Cramer's week ahead: Earnings from Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/25/cramers-week-ahead-earnings-from-alphabet-meta-apple-microsoft-and-amazon.html,"With massive corporations including Alphabet , Meta , Apple , Microsoft and Amazon set to report earnings next week, CNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday urged investors to keep a level head. He also said not to forget about the nonfarm payroll report next Friday, where a weak hiring result could urge the Federal Reserve to keep cutting rates.

""Huge opportunity,"" he said. ""Just please remember, the first move's been the wrong move almost half the time since this earnings season began. Wait to process the numbers and listen to the conference calls before you pull the trigger.""

Monday starts off the week with earnings from Ford . Cramer said he wishes the automaker giant will report a clean quarter with no issues from warranty costs and not too much lost on electric vehicles.

Tuesday brings McDonald's earnings report, and Cramer said to expect ""a full airing of the e-coli situation,"" but that it is too early to tell how much damage it will do to the fast food chain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states. 



Cramer predicts Royal Caribbean , Reddit and PayPal to all report a large beat and raise in year-end guidance.

Alphabet will report after the close on Tuesday. While the tech behemoth's stock has been all over the map, Cramer said it has been ""rarely in a good way."" He said Alphabet is a great company, but not a solid stock as the leadership doesn't seem to prioritize what investors want to hear. 



Cramer said he believes Advanced Micro Devices will do well enough to take parts of Nvidia's business. Chipotle will report its earnings for the first time since former-CEO Brian Niccol's left the helm to run Starbucks , and Cramer said he believes announcing a permanent CEO would help the stock.

Another large slate of reports are set for Wednesday, including Caterpillar and Eli Lilly . Cramer said he saw the former's machines all over Chevron's floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico, but isn't sure whether the likely strong report will be enough to move the already hot stock. The latter has had a strong run on the back of the GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, and Cramer said a Stifel report on the negative impact weight-loss drugs may have on food stock means Eli Lilly stocks will benefit. 



Meta and Microsoft will dominate the after-the-bell reports, and while Cramer said he believes Meta can continue its phenomenal quarterly run, he isn't too sure whether Microsoft will be able to convince investors that its AI-tool Copilot is as strong as advertised. Two more companies Cramer said will likely show a hot quarter, Booking Holding and DoorDash , will shed more light on consumers prior to the nonfarm payroll report.

The monster week for earnings will continue into Thursday, as both Apple and Amazon will report after the bell. Even after the lackluster iPhone 16 launch, Cramer said ""we've seen this movie before"" with the company and the best strategy is to hold on. 



Another moment not to panic, he said Amazon is doing well and not to dogpile on the potential hammering the stock received last quarter. Cramer said he believes two drug stocks, Merck and Bristol-Myers , are too low, but if Friday brings a weak employment number then they are two stocks investors should not have bought.

On Friday, the nonfarm payroll report will be released, and Cramer said he ""can't stress how important this number is."" He said continued strong employment will mean no November interest rate cut, and even though some investors will want to sell, fed rate cut cycles are times to buy. Oil titans Chevron and Exxon will report the same day. 



Cramer said he was impressed on his trip by the way Chevron's returned a huge amount of capital in dividends and buybacks even though it is still the worst performer in the group. He also said Exxon is more loved than Chevron from the battle over the Hess acquisition, even as Exxon doesn't have as much earnings power, and suggested people should switch sides.",AAPL,yes,fmp,838

Alphabet Stock: Which Magnificent 7 Stock Performs Better In The Long Run?,https://www.benzinga.com/tech/24/10/41555871/apple-stock-vs-alphabet-stock-which-magnificent-7-stock-performs-better-in-the-long-run,"Apple Inc AAPL and Alphabet GOOGGOOGL are rivals, partners and members of the Magnificent 7.

While both stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five and 10 years, one has performed significantly better.

Rivals and Partners: Apple and Alphabet are both smartphone companies competing against each other for market share in the lucrative growth market.

While the companies compete against each other for smartphone market share, Alphabet also pays Apple for being the official search provider on iPhones.

This lucrative deal, which is worth an estimated $25 billion and could make up 6% of Apple's revenue could be under pressure with the U.S. Department of Justice looking into antitrust allegations for Alphabet's Google search division.

Stock Performance: In 2024, Apple outperformed Alphabet for stock returns. Here's a look at the historical stock price returns for Apple, Alphabet and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, which tracks the S&P 500.

The chart shows that Alphabet trails the S&P 500 on a year-to-date and one-year basis, while Apple ranks ahead of the S&P 500 on all metrics.

Looking at the five-year and 10-year performances, Apple has significantly outperformed Alphabet.

Financials: Both Apple and Alphabet are among the top revenue-producing companies on an annual basis and bring in plenty of net income, which translates to strong earnings per share year after year.

In fiscal 2023, Apple had revenue of $383.3 billion and net income of $97.0 billion. Alphabet posted revenue of $307.4 billion and net income of $74.0 billion.

While Apple had the higher revenue total for the last full fiscal year, the company posted a 2.8% year-over-year decline for revenue. Alphabet posted a 9% year-over-year increase for revenue.

Going forward, both stocks will be closely watched for who has the higher growth and better stock performance.

Both stocks have dividend yields of less than 1%, which likely doesn't make the stocks as attractive for dividend investors.

For value investors, both stocks trade at high multiple, but it is Alphabet who currently trades at the lower price-to-earnings multiple of 23.68, versus Apple's 35.43.

AAPL, GOOGL Price Action: Apple stock trades at $231.57 at the time of writing versus a 52-week trading range of $164.08 to $237.49.

Alphabet stock trades at $165.01 at the time of writing versus a 52-week trading range of $120.21 to $191.75.
• Apple CEO Tim Cook Uses iPhone, Apple Watch ‘Every Day,’ Says Apple Intelligence Has ‘Changed My Life’",AAPL,yes,fmp,583
2024-10-25 15:16:53,"What is Apple Intelligence, when is it coming and who will get it?",https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/what-is-apple-intelligence-when-is-coming-and-who-will-get-it/,"After months of speculation, Apple Intelligence took center stage at WWDC 2024 in June. The platform was announced in the wake of a torrent of generative AI news from companies like Google and Open AI, causing concern that the famously tight-lipped tech giant had missed the boat on the latest tech craze.

Contrary to such speculation, however, Apple had a team in place, working on what proved to be a very Apple approach to artificial intelligence. There was still pizzazz amid the demos — Apple always loves to put on a show — but Apple Intelligence is ultimately a very pragmatic take on the category.

Apple Intelligence (yes, AI for short) isn’t a standalone feature. Rather, it’s about integrating into existing offerings. While it is a branding exercise in a very real sense, the large language model (LLM) driven technology will operate behind the scenes. As far as the consumer is concerned, the technology will mostly present itself in the form of new features for existing apps.

We learned more during the Apple’s iPhone 16 event, which was held on September 9. During the event, Apple touted a number of AI-powered features coming to their devices, from translation on the Apple Watch Series 10, visual search on iPhones and a number of tweaks to Siri’s capabilities. The first wave of Apple Intelligence is arriving at the end of October, as part of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. A second wave of features are available as part of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 developer betas.

The features launched first in U.S. English. Apple has since added Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, South African, and U.K. English localizations.

Support for Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will arrive in 2025. Notably, users in both China and the EU may not get any access to Apple Intelligence features, owing to regulatory hurdles.

Cupertino marketing executives have branded Apple Intelligence: “AI for the rest of us.” The platform is designed to leverage the things that generative AI already does well, like text and image generation, to improve upon existing features. Like other platforms including ChatGPT and Google Gemini, Apple Intelligence was trained on large information models. These systems use deep learning to form connections, whether it be text, images, video or music.

The text offering, powered by LLM, presents itself as Writing Tools. The feature is available across various Apple apps, including Mail, Messages, Pages and Notifications. It can be used to provide summaries of long text, proofread and even write messages for you, using content and tone prompts.

Image generation has been integrated as well, in similar fashion — albeit a bit less seamlessly. Users can prompt Apple Intelligence to generate custom emojis (Genmojis) in an Apple house style. Image Playground, meanwhile, is a standalone image generation app that utilizes prompts to create visual content than can be used in Messages, Keynote or shared via social media.

Apple Intelligence also marks a long-awaited face-lift for Siri. The smart assistant was early to the game, but has mostly been neglected for the past several years. Siri is integrated much more deeply into Apple’s operating systems; for instance, instead of the familiar icon, users will see a glowing light around the edge of their iPhone screen when it’s doing its thing.

More important, new Siri works across apps. That means, for example, that you can ask Siri to edit a photo and then insert it directly into a text message. It’s a frictionless experience the assistant had previously lacked. Onscreen awareness means Siri uses the context of the content you’re currently engaged with to provide an appropriate answer.

Who gets Apple Intelligence and when?

The first wave of Apple Intelligence arrives in October via iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18., and macOS Sequoia 15.1 updates. These include integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience.

Many remaining features will be added with the forthcoming release of of October, as part of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. A second wave of features are available as part of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2. That list includes, Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, Image Wand, and ChatGPT integration.

The offering will be free to use, so long as you have one of the following pieces of hardware:

Notably, only the Pro versions of the iPhone 15 are getting access, owing to shortcomings on the standard model’s chipset. Presumably, however, the whole iPhone 16 line will be able to run Apple Intelligence when it arrives.

Apple has taken a small-model, bespoke approach to training. Rather than relying on the kind of kitchen sink approach that fuels platforms like GPT and Gemini, the company has compiled datasets in-house for specific tasks like, say, composing an email. The biggest benefit of this approach is that many of these tasks become far less resource intensive and can be performed on-device.

That doesn’t apply to everything, however. More complex queries will utilize the new Private Cloud Compute offering. The company now operates remote servers running on Apple Silicon, which it claims allows it to offer the same level of privacy as its consumer devices. Whether an action is being performed locally or via the cloud will be invisible to the user, unless their device is offline, at which point remote queries will toss up an error.

A lot was made about Apple’s pending partnership with OpenAI ahead of WWDC. Ultimately, however, it turned out that the deal was less about powering Apple Intelligence and more about offering an alternative platform for those things it’s not really built for. It’s a tacit acknowledgement that building a small-model system has its limitation.

Apple Intelligence is free. So, too, is access to ChatGPT. However, those with paid accounts to the latter will have access to premium features free users don’t, including unlimited queries.

ChatGPT integration, which debuts on iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, has two primary roles: supplementing Siri’s knowledge base and adding to the existing Writing Tools options.

With the service enabled, certain questions will prompt the new Siri to ask the user to approve its accessing ChatGPT. Recipes and travel planning are examples of questions that may surface the option. Users can also directly prompt Siri to “ask ChatGPT.”

Compose is the other primary ChatGPT feature available through Apple Intelligence. Users can access it in any app that supports the new Writing Tools feature. Compose adds the ability to write content based on a prompt. That joins existing writing tools like Style and Summary.

We know for sure that Apple plans to partner with additional generative AI services. The company all but said that Google Gemini is next on that list.",AAPL,yes,fmp,1457

2024-10-25 12:38:01,Nvidia overtakes Apple as world's most valuable company with $3.5T valuation,https://nypost.com/2024/10/25/business/nvidia-overtakes-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company/,"Nvidia briefly dethroned Apple as the world’s most valuable company on Friday, following a record-setting rally in the stock powered by an insatiable demand for its new supercomputing AI chips.

Nvidia’s stock market value briefly touched $3.53 trillion in intraday trading, while that of Apple was $3.52 trillion, according to data from LSEG. Nvidia finished the session with a $3.47 trillion market cap, while Apple held steady..

In June, Nvidia briefly became the world’s most valuable company, before it was overtaken by Microsoft and Apple. The tech trio’s market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months. Microsoft’s market value stood at $3.20 trillion.

Nvidia’s stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion. Nvidia provides chips used to train so-called foundation models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4.

“More companies are now embracing artificial intelligence in their everyday tasks and demand remains strong for Nvidia chips,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

“It is certainly in a sweet spot and so long as we avoid a big economic downturn in the United States, there is a feeling that companies will continue to invest heavily in AI capabilities, creating a healthy tailwind for Nvidia.”

Nvidia’s shares hit a record high on Tuesday, building on a rally from last week when TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, posted a forecast-beating 54% jump in quarterly profit driven by soaring demand for chips used in AI.

The next big test will be when Nvidia reports third-quarter results in November. Nvidia in August forecast third-quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, compared with the current average analyst expectation of $32.90 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note dated Oct. 10 that he remains “very bullish” about the company longer term, but the recent rally “raises the bar for earnings somewhat.”

After a meeting with Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, Moore noted the ramp up in production of its next-generation Blackwell chips appeared to be “quite strong” and are booked out for 12 months. The stock came under pressure in August after Nvidia confirmed reports that the production of Blackwell chips was delayed until the fourth quarter.

Shares of Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft have an outsized influence on the richly valued technology sector as well as the broader US stock market, with the trio accounting for about a fifth of the S&P 500 index’s weightage.

Frenzy around the prospects of AI, expectations that the Federal Reserve will considerably bring down interest rates, and most recently, an upbeat start to the earnings season, have pushed the benchmark S&P 500 to an all-time high last week.

Nvidia’s massive gains have helped boost the stock’s appeal for option traders and the company’s options are among the most traded on any given day in recent months, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert.

The stock has surged nearly 190% so far this year as a boom in generative AI prompted the company to issue a series of blowout forecasts.

“The question is whether the revenue stream will last for a long time and will be driven by the emotion of investors rather than by any ability to prove or disprove the thesis that AI is overdone,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, NJ.

Apple has been on a roll in 2024, up 34% for the year to date, to make it one of the best-performing Dow Jones stocks. But KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel is concerned about iPhone 16 sales. He thinks customers will favor buying the new lower-priced iPhone SE model, which is expected to launch in early 2025, over the costlier iPhone 16, according to Barron's.

The iPhone 16 price ranges from $799 to $1,199, while the iPhone SE 4 is expected to cost around $499, by some estimates.

Nispel cited a recent survey that found 59% of respondents said they were interested in upgrading to the iPhone 16, and of those likely or extremely likely to upgrade, 61% indicated interest in the iPhone SE.

""This shows the iPhone SE isn't incremental, and could possibly be cannibalistic to iPhone 16 sales,"" the analyst said, adding that a successful launch of the iPhone SE would lead to an increase in iPhone units sold but a decline in average selling prices.

Nispel's $200 price target represents a discount of about 14% to current levels.

Apple could do well in China's thriving smartphone market

On a positive note for Apple, smartphone shipments in China rose 3.2% year over year in the third quarter, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of expansion, according to the Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.

Apple came in second for smartphone companies, driven by the launch of its new iPhone 16 series, and its artificial intelligence (AI) model Apple Intelligence is expected to drive future demand.

""A significant wave of device upgrades is propelling the sustained recovery of the Chinese smartphone market,"" IDC senior research analyst said in a statement. ""Despite ongoing economic challenges, consumers are highly motivated to purchase new smartphones after three years of pent-up demand.""

Apple is still a Buy for most of Wall Street

The majority of Wall Street remains bullish toward the blue chip, suggesting investors shouldn't be too worried about KeyBanc's downgrade of one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks.

According to , the average analyst target price for AAPL stock is $239.82, representing implied upside of over 3% from current levels. Additionally, the consensus recommendation is Buy.

Financial services firm CFRA is one of the more bullish outfits on AAPL stock with a Buy rating and $260 price target.

Looking ahead to Apple's upcoming earnings event, slated for after the close on Thursday, October 31, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino is expecting year-over-year services growth of 13%, ""while anticipating more insights around the rollout of AI (initially only available in English), with international expansion to be a bigger story in calendar year 2025 and calendar year 2026.""

Zino adds that ""AAPL could refresh its Macs this fall, with internal M4 processors, while Wearables is set to return to growth given recent upgrades to the Watch and AirPods product lines.""

The Q3 cycle looks to be positive, underpinned by another robust showing from technology.

And next week, we have several Mag 7 members on the reporting docket, a list that includes but is not limited to Meta Platforms ( Free Report) and Apple ( Free Report) .

Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks

Currently, the Magnificent 7 group as a whole is expected to post 16.2% earnings growth on 13.6% higher sales, as we can see in the chart below.

Let’s take a closer look at individual expectations for Meta Platforms and Apple.

META shares have been notably strong in 2024, reflecting one of the top Mag 7 performers overall in 2024. While other members have seen their shares primarily trade sideways over recent months, bullish sentiment has remained for the stock leading up to its quarterly release.

Earnings expectations for the quarter to be reported have remained positive since the beginning of August, with the $5.17 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 2% since and suggesting 18% growth year-over-year. Positive earnings estimate revisions have landed the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Revenue revisions have followed a similar trajectory, with the company expected to see 17% sales growth from the year-ago period. As usual, the company’s advertising performance will be a focal point, which has performed strongly over recent periods partly thanks to the implementation of AI capabilities.

As shown below, Advertising results have consistently beaten our consensus expectations, with the company stringing together six consecutive positive surprises.

Investors should expect to hear further commentary surrounding its AI roadmap, particularly on the capital expenditures (CapEx) side of things. The valuation picture heading into the release isn’t concerning, with the current 23.7X forward 12-month earnings multiple not too far off from the 22.1X five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 31.5X.

In addition, the current PEG works out to 1.2X, again in line with historical averages and a fraction of the 2.9X five-year high.

Expectations for Apple’s upcoming release have reflected slight bearishness, with downward revisions recently hitting the tape near the beginning of October. Modest growth is forecasted, with the current $1.54 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting a 5% climb year-over-year.

A key item to keep an eye on during the upcoming release is the company’s iPhone results, which generally always take center stage. Investors should expect a decent bit of commentary surrounding the new iPhone 16 and the upcoming AI capabilities that the company has been touting over recent months.

As shown below, iPhone results have exceeded our consensus expectations in two of its last three quarterly releases.

The valuation picture here is slightly stretched, with the current forward 12-month earnings multiple of 30.3X well above the 26.3X five-year median but beneath five-year highs of 36.1X.

And the current PEG works out to 2.4X, again above the 2.2X five-year median. While valuation multiples may be a bit steep, investors have had little issue paying a premium for shares given the company’s rock-solid fundamentals.

We’ve got several notable companies – Apple ( Free Report) and Meta Platforms ( Free Report) – on the reporting docket for next week, who will help kick off the reporting cycle for the broader Mag 7 group.

Investors should keep a close watch on META’s commentary surrounding CapEx, with Advertising results again expected to be a focal point. Earnings estimate revisions have been favorable heading into the release, with valuation multiples sitting fairly as well.

Concerning Apple, the big highlight will be iPhone results, with extensive commentary expected surrounding the previously announced AI capabilities.",AAPL,yes,fmp,807

(IDC) said.

According to IDC, the tech giant's 15.6% share of the Chinese smartphone market declined from 16.1% a year ago but nevertheless was good for the second-most sales. Chinese firm vivo was the top seller.

Apple fell out of the top five in IDC's research during the second quarter, as its sales in China struggled in the first half of the year as domestic competitors like Huawei, vivo, and Xiaomi gained ground.

With the launch of the iPhone 16 and flagship brands from competitors, the smartphone market is picking up again despite China's slowing economy, with IDC noting third-quarter sales rose 3.2% year-over-year to 68.8 million units.

""A significant wave of device upgrades is propelling the sustained recovery of the Chinese smartphone market,"" IDC China senior research analyst Arthur Guo said. ""Despite ongoing economic challenges, consumers are highly motivated to purchase new smartphones after three years of pent-up demand.""

Apple has yet to include its latest artificial intelligence (AI) features into its new devices in China, a delay that analysts have said could cause the tech giant to lose ground against competitors. Apple Intelligence will be rolled out in English-language devices in coming weeks and in other languages like Spanish and Chinese next year.

They’ll also be able to view metrics related to the beta’s success, in terms of how many people viewed the invite and opted in, and why others did not.

The changes will make it easier for developers to target their betas and gain more feedback ahead of their app’s public debut on the App Store. Meanwhile, for beta testers, the redesigned invitations will offer more information about the app, helping them make a decision as to whether or not they want to join the test group.

With the update,invitations now highlight new features or content coming to the app or game, which could encourage testers to try it out. In addition, Apple says the beta builds of apps and games that have been already approved for publication the App Store will be able to include screenshots and the app category along with their invite. This will make the beta testing experience feel more like downloading from the App Store. It could also challenge the alternative testing marketplaces that have popped up in recent years, like Airport, which includes app screenshots, and Departures, which organizes apps into categories.

The ability to set criteria for TestFlight testing, meanwhile, helps developers narrow their test groups to specific audiences, like those using a particular device type or OS version. Given that TestFlight offers a max of 10,000 invitations, this could help save spots in a more popular beta from going to those who can’t yet use the app on their device or aren’t a part of the intended audience for the test. Developers can set a maximum number of testers in the group, to further control access.

The new invites will also be sent out from a new public link that will include new metrics like how many testers viewed the invite and then chose to accept it. Developers will be able to see how many potential testers didn’t meet the criteria they set, as well. Users, meanwhile, will be able to leave feedback for the developer, to help them understand why they didn’t join the beta for other reasons.",AAPL,yes,fmp,454

2024-10-25 07:59:11,"Analyst downgrades Apple stock, sets next APPL low target",https://finbold.com/analyst-downgrades-apple-stock-sets-next-appl-low-target/,"KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel is forecasting more downside for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock, citing several issues, primarily regarding market reception for the company’s latest iPhone 16 series.

In an investor note on October 25, Nispel downgraded Apple (AAPL) to “Underweight” from “Sector Weight,” setting a price target of $200.

The downgrade comes as Apple stock faces increased short-term volatility, dropping over 2% in the past week. At the close of the last trading session, AAPL was valued at $230.57, ending the day down less than 0.1%.

This weakness appears set to continue heading into the October 25 session, where the stock has shed $2.15 in pre-market trading.

When reviewing KeyBanc’s downgrade, the analyst cited concerns about potential cannibalization within Apple’s iPhone lineup.

Nispel referenced a recent consumer survey showing that 59% of respondents were interested in upgrading to the anticipated iPhone 16; however, 61% also showed interest in the lower-cost iPhone SE.

Moreover, recent data indicates a persistent slowdown in postpaid upgrade rates, down 9% year-over-year. Despite some improvement, Nispel projects mid-single-digit declines in Q4 and ongoing low-single-digit declines in the first half of 2025.

The analyst also expressed skepticism regarding Wall Street’s growth expectations, noting that Apple has only achieved growth across all product categories and regions twice in the past 20 years, most recently in 2021. Given this historical context, he questioned the likelihood of sustained, broad-based growth in 2025.

Additionally, he highlighted Apple’s elevated valuation, which stands at 23 times the projected 2025 EBITDA, a significant premium to the Nasdaq. Nispel’s $200 price target is based on a valuation adjustment to more closely align with Apple’s historical average.

Indeed, Apple’s recent price struggles were partly due to a report warning of waning demand for the iPhone 16. In this regard, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from TF International Securities indicated that the tech giant had reduced iPhone 16 orders by about 10 million units, affecting Q4 2024 and the first half of 2025.

In this context, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) analyst Erik Woodring observed that iPhone lead times appear “encouraging,” with September shipments reaching 56 million units—about 10% above initial expectations.

It’s worth noting that since the iPhone 16’s release, market reception and sales estimates have remained lackluster, providing a basis for analysts’ revised forecasts for the stock.

As reported by Finbold, Bernstein’s Toni Sacconaghi noted on October 23 that demand for the phone is likely to recover in the coming months, leading to an “Outperform” rating with a $240 price target after the company’s Q4 results.

Amid the price outlook, optimistic analysts believe the stock might rally to $300 by the end of 2024, with potential catalysts including the company’s adoption of artificial intelligence.

To this end, Dan Ives from Wedbush projected that Apple’s integration of AI technology will kickstart a new tech supercycle, potentially pushing AAPL stock to skyrocket and giving the company a valuation of $4 trillion.

Meanwhile, Apple may need to reinvent itself to spur growth in key markets such as China. For instance, Q3 2024 data showed that Apple’s iPhone sales in China slipped 0.3%, while Huawei posted 42% growth.

From a technical perspective, Kang, a pseudonymous stock trader in an X on October 23, noted that AAPL had formed a bearish pattern known as a bear pennant, suggesting potential downside pressure in the near term.

This outlook is supported by the stock’s pattern of lower highs and higher lows, accompanied by shrinking volume, which indicates weakening momentum as the stock struggles to break higher.

Notably, if AAPL fails to break and sustain prices above $230, this could confirm the bear pennant and lead to a breakdown toward support levels below $228.",AAPL,yes,fmp,841

2024-10-25 07:31:32,Maximize Portfolio Income with These 3 Dividend ETFs,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/maximize-portfolio-income-with-these-3-dividend-etfs/,"Dividend stocks offer multiple benefits for retail investors: in addition to providing a steady stream of passive income which can be reinvested to boost portfolio performance, dividends are usually a signal that a company has strong stability. Companies focused on growth—or struggling to manage one or more elements of their business operations—are typically not in a position to pay money out to investors in the form of dividends.

When selecting a dividend stock, investors often look to factors including dividend yield and payout ratio or to a history of boosting dividend payouts as indicators of a winning choice. Still, even the most established dividend-paying firms can sometimes face unexpected turmoil or otherwise have reason to reduce or eliminate payouts. As is often the case in equities investing, targeting a broader group of dividend stocks can help to minimize this risk, as well as overall performance risk. Dividend stock ETFs are an excellent way to generate income over time.

The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF NYSEARCA: SCHD is a well-rounded and competitively priced dividend ETF. It targets a portfolio of around 100 large-cap U.S. firms that are selected based on their long history of paying dividends. The fund also factors in elements including yield and dividend growth, helping to ensure that companies included in the portfolio have fundamentals to support continued dividend strength going forward. SCHD's top holdings include dividend stalwarts like Cisco NASDAQ: CSCO and Home Depot Inc. NYSE: HD.

With more than $63 billion in assets under management and a one-month average trading volume of about 11 million, SCHD is liquid and unlikely to cause investors to incur unexpected trading fees, making it ideal for more active traders. Additionally, the basket is not overweighted toward a small number of top stocks but reaches a limit of around 4.4% allocation for any individual company, ensuring it is broadly diversified.

Like SCHD, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF NYSEARCA: VYM also focuses on large-cap U.S. stocks, but its approach is distinguished by the size of its portfolio and its emphasis on dividend yield. VYM has more than five times as many holdings as SCHD, with over 500 stocks in its portfolio. These firms are selected based on dividend yield and value characteristics.

Large-cap, dividend-paying value companies are often seen as highly stable, making VYM an excellent choice for a diversified dividend ETF for buy-and-hold investors. Its diversification is also a standout characteristic, making this fund even more attractive for investors looking for steady passive income.

Another large-cap U.S. fund, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF NYSEARCA: VIG, has a slightly different focus from VYM above. Rather than target stocks with an appealing value proposition, VIG seeks firms with the potential for future growth. Another key consideration for selection in VIG's portfolio is dividend payout growth. To be included, a company must have a history of at least 10 consecutive years of annual dividend increases.

VIG's portfolio of about 340 stocks is also widely diversified, although not quite as broad as VYM above. A couple of heavy-hitting tech stocks—Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL and Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO—are slightly more heavily weighted but still come in at under 5% of total assets.

There are dozens of dividend stock ETFs currently available, giving investors no shortage of options. These funds offer a surprising array of different strategies, from broad-based approaches like SCHD above to a highly specialized focus on a single metric (such as dividend yield). They also differ in portfolio makeup, including multiple market capitalization categories, geographic specializations, and more.

The three ETFs above all share an expense ratio of 0.06%. While this is not the lowest fee across the dividend ETF space, it is highly competitive. Further, they all enjoy strong asset bases and performance histories, making each a good general dividend ETF. Investors looking for a niche dividend ETF product may wish to explore the space further, though they should be prepared to pay more for a targeted fund.

Apple stock has had a good run this year, rising by about 23% since early January, with the stock now trading near all-time highs. We expect revenue to come in at $94.5 billion, up about 13% year-over-year, while earnings are likely to come in at $1.56 per share, about 15% ahead of last year’s number. Both our estimates are slightly ahead of the consensus.

Apple’s iPhone business could see some growth this quarter

According to estimates from IDC, Apple shipped 56 million iPhones in Q3 CY2024, up 3.5% year-over-year, although its overall smartphone market share declined a bit. While growth is likely to be driven in part by the new iPhone 16 lineup, which went on sale about 10 days before the quarter closed, the last generation iPhone 15 was likely the biggest driver of sales, amid considerable promotional offers and buzz surrounding Apple’s latest software updates. However, the iPhone has been facing headwinds in China, one of its largest markets amid higher competition from the likes of Huawei, who has been gaining ground in the high-end of the market.

Apple’s Greater China revenue for the first nine months of the fiscal year was down almost 10% compared to the year-ago period. Apple’s Mac business could have a tough quarter, as customers likely held off on purchases and wait for newer models with the latest upgraded M4 processors. Apple’s digital services business should fare well, driven by higher sales at the AppStore and improving the uptake of other subscription services. Over Q3 FY’24, services sales grew 14% to $24.2 billion. See our breakdown of Apple’s services business revenues.

The increase in AAPL stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 35% in 2021, -27% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AAPL face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

We value Apple at about $219 per share, which is slightly below the current market price of about $236. Apple stock trades at about 35x FY’24 earnings, which is elevated compared to historical levels. However, Apple should see revenue growth pick up from the next fiscal year, driven by the introduction of new generative AI offerings that are only compatible with the company’s latest devices - a move that could drive an upgrade cycle for consumers with legacy iPhones and iPads. Apple’s margins should also continue to remain strong. Gross margins came in at 46% for the first nine months of this fiscal year, reaching near all-time highs, up from about 44% in the year-ago period, driven by a more favorable product mix, and a higher percentage of service sales.

2024-10-25 05:02:00,"Meet the Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Taiwan Semiconductor in the $1 Trillion Club by 2030.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/25/meet-the-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-apple-n/,"Decades of information technology (IT) and cloud systems expertise could drive this artificial intelligence (AI) specialist to new heights.

One of the biggest secular tailwinds of the past several years has been that of artificial intelligence (AI). Lest there be any question, a quick scan of the top-ranking companies by market cap helps to dispel any remaining doubts. In fact, nearly all the companies in the $1 trillion club have one thing in common -- they are each developing, deploying, or manufacturing products on the cutting edge of AI.

Apple has a long history of integrating sophisticated algorithms to give its state-of-the-art products an edge. Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the technology that makes generative AI possible. Microsoft joined forces with OpenAI to spur the evolution of ChatGPT. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have all developed top-shelf generative AI models that are bringing the technology to the masses. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the foundry that produces the vast majority of the most advanced chips used for AI.

With a market cap of just $483 billion, it might seem premature to nominate Oracle (ORCL -0.49%) for membership in this prestigious fraternity. However, the company's recent business performance and management's forecast suggest that the accelerating demand for generative AI could drive additional growth for years to come.

Oracle has previously reported that 98% of Global Fortune 500 companies use some combination of its database, cloud, and enterprise software. This puts the company in a prime position to help new and potential customers interested in adopting AI.

This has helped fuel robust overall growth. During Oracle's fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Aug 31), revenue grew 7% year over year to $13.3 billion, while its operating income growth accelerated to 21% -- but that's just the beginning.

Oracle continues to experience a surge of new business, and CEO Safra Catz pointed out a growing trend of customers opting for ""larger and longer contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud services are benefiting their businesses."" This trend is fueling the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contracts not yet included in revenue -- which surged 53% year over year to $99 billion. When RPO is growing faster than revenue, it points to a robust pipeline of revenue growth, which bodes well for the future.

As a result, the company expects its fiscal 2025 revenue to accelerate in each successive quarter, ultimately growing by double-digits for the year. In the second quarter, Oracle expects its revenue growth rate to climb to 8% at the midpoint of its guidance, fueled by cloud revenue growth of 24%. This will drive adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8%.

Oracle has a distinguished track record of helping customers adopt appropriate cloud solutions, which makes it easier when they make the decision to join the AI revolution. That said, this paradigm shift will take years, if not decades, to complete.

According to Wall Street, Oracle is expected to generate revenue of $58 billion in its fiscal 2025 (which began Jun. 1), giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Oracle would need to grow its revenue to approximately $120 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. Analysts are forecasting revenue growth of about 20% for the full fiscal year and 12% thereafter. If the company achieves these benchmarks, Oracle could reach the $1 trillion market cap by 2032.

However, management just increased its outlook and is guiding for revenue of at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029, which works out to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 16%. If Oracle hits its internal targets, it will likely reach a market cap of $1 trillion by 2030 -- if not sooner.

Estimates regarding the impact of generative AI continue to ratchet higher. The market could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.

If the company can continue to serve customers looking to adopt AI, this will reflect in its growth rate and Oracle will join the ranks of trillionaires sooner than investors might imagine.",AAPL,yes,fmp,872

2024-10-25 04:50:00,Prediction: This Will Be Apple's Next Big Move,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/25/prediction-this-will-be-apples-next-big-move/,"The iPhone maker could get a big boost if it decides to make this move.

Apple (AAPL 0.36%) brought about a revolution in the smartphone market in 2007 when it launched its first-ever iPhone, changing the fortunes of established smartphone companies such as Nokia and BlackBerry (known as Research in Motion at that time).

It's worth noting that Apple sold just 1.4 million iPhones in 2007. For comparison, the popular Nokia 3310 sold 7.4 million units in the fourth quarter of that year alone. The Nokia device was seven years old at that time, and it was simply a feature phone. However, Apple changed the game by infusing the internet, entertainment, and a touchscreen into the same device.

Apple has come a long way since then. It was the top seller of smartphones in 2023, according to IDC. The company shipped 234.6 million iPhones last year and controlled 20.1% of the market. It was slightly ahead of Samsung, which had a 19.4% share of the smartphone space last year. The two companies have long been involved in a fierce duel for smartphone supremacy and are now looking at artificial intelligence (AI) to unlock the next growth frontier in this space.

Samsung has been ahead of Apple in the generative AI smartphone market so far. However, Apple made its AI move in June this year when it introduced Apple Intelligence, a suite of generative AI features. Let's take a closer look at Apple Intelligence and see why the company could use this feature to boost its growth.

Apple says its generative AI platform will unlock ""new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively."" From enabling users to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text to recording, transcribing, and summarizing audio to a more intelligent Siri, there are a bunch of tools that Apple Intelligence users will get access to.

Apple hasn't announced whether it will charge a fee for its generative AI features. However, there is a strong likelihood of the company heading in that direction. That's because Apple isn't just a hardware company. The tech giant has a flourishing services business that has generated $71 billion in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, accounting for nearly a quarter of its top line.

The important thing here is that the services business has a much fatter margin profile than Apple's product business. Apple's services business reported a 74% gross margin in the fiscal third quarter, compared to the product segment's gross margin of 35%. The services business currently has a range of offerings that include cloud storage, music, TV, gaming, fitness, and news.

The company offers these services through a subscription model under the Apple One umbrella. An individual subscription starts from just under $20 a month, while the family plan costs just under $26 a month. The top-end plan can be purchased for just under $38 a month.

The addition of Apple Intelligence to this plan could help the company further increase its revenue from the services business, which is approaching an annual revenue run rate of $100 billion (based on the services revenue generated in the first nine months of fiscal 2024).

Wall Street analysts and research firms believe that Apple could charge a subscription for access to advanced Apple Intelligence features. Counterpoint Research, for instance, anticipates that the company could charge between $10 to $20 a month for Apple Intelligence features when it includes them in the Apple One plans. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, on the other hand, predicts that Apple will first offer generative AI features for free, but be likely to charge for advanced features.

Note that Microsoft is doing something similar with its Copilot AI assistant. It offers the standard version of Copilot for free, but the paid plans start at $20 a month and go up to $200 a month based on the number of features users opt for. Customers have been paying for Microsoft Copilot, and the company has already built a strong base of paid customers for this service.

A huge installed base of users means Apple could make a lot of money from AI

In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the installed base of the company's active devices stood at 2.2 billion. That's a massive number that could pave the way for the quick monetization of Apple Intelligence since the company is going to offer its AI features across MacBooks, iPads, and iPhones.

Of course, Apple Intelligence isn't compatible with all those devices. The features are currently only supported by the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the iPhone 16 lineup, and iPads and Macs running on M1 chips or later. Of its huge installed base, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates that 1.5 billion active devices are iPhones. Around 20% of those iPhones haven't been upgraded in four years, which means that roughly 300 million users could end up buying Apple's generative AI-enabled smartphones.

On the other hand, the growing demand for AI-enabled personal computers (PCs) could encourage customers to buy new MacBooks that support AI features. So, there's a strong likelihood of an increase in Apple's product sales because of AI. That should eventually filter down to the services business if Apple decides to charge a subscription for its AI features.

Assuming Apple decides to charge even $10 a month for its AI services and manages to get 300 million paying customers, it could generate $3 billion every month from the monetization of Apple Intelligence. However, that number could be higher if subscription charges are higher, or if a bigger portion of its installed base starts using its offerings.

Apple's services business is approaching $100 billion in annual revenue, and it could get a big shot in the arm if the prediction about charging for Apple Intelligence features comes true. Throw in the potential rise in sales of Apple's hardware, and it won't be surprising to see an uptick in the pace of this tech giant's growth.",AAPL,yes,fmp,1216

2024-10-24 14:57:42,Meta just beat Google and Apple in the race to put powerful AI on phones,https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-just-beat-google-and-apple-in-the-race-to-put-powerful-ai-on-phones/,"Meta Platforms has created smaller versions of its Llama artificial intelligence models that can run on smartphones and tablets, opening new possibilities for AI beyond data centers.

The company announced compressed versions of its Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models today that run up to four times faster while using less than half the memory of earlier versions. These smaller models perform nearly as well as their larger counterparts, according to Meta’s testing.

The advancement uses a compression technique called quantization, which simplifies the mathematical calculations that power AI models. Meta combined two methods: Quantization-Aware Training with LoRA adaptors (QLoRA) to maintain accuracy, and SpinQuant to improve portability.

This technical achievement solves a key problem: running advanced AI without massive computing power. Until now, sophisticated AI models required data centers and specialized hardware.

Tests on OnePlus 12 Android phones showed the compressed models were 56% smaller and used 41% less memory while processing text more than twice as fast. The models can handle texts up to 8,000 characters, enough for most mobile apps.

Meta’s release intensifies a strategic battle among tech giants to control how AI runs on mobile devices. While Google and Apple take careful, controlled approaches to mobile AI — keeping it tightly integrated with their operating systems — Meta’s strategy is markedly different.

By open-sourcing these compressed models and partnering with chip makers Qualcomm and MediaTek, Meta bypasses traditional platform gatekeepers. Developers can build AI applications without waiting for Google’s Android updates or Apple’s iOS features. This move echoes the early days of mobile apps, when open platforms dramatically accelerated innovation.

The partnerships with Qualcomm and MediaTek are particularly significant. These companies power most of the world’s Android phones, including devices in emerging markets where Meta sees growth potential. By optimizing its models for these widely-used processors, Meta ensures its AI can run efficiently on phones across different price points — not just premium devices.

The decision to distribute through both Meta’s Llama website and Hugging Face, the increasingly influential AI model hub, shows Meta’s commitment to reaching developers where they already work. This dual distribution strategy could help Meta’s compressed models become the de facto standard for mobile AI development, much as TensorFlow and PyTorch became standards for machine learning.

The future of AI in your pocket

Meta’s announcement today points to a larger shift in artificial intelligence: the move from centralized to personal computing. While cloud-based AI will continue to handle complex tasks, these new models suggest a future where phones can process sensitive information privately and quickly.

The timing is significant. Tech companies face mounting pressure over data collection and AI transparency. Meta’s approach — making these tools open and running them directly on phones — addresses both concerns. Your phone, not a distant server, could soon handle tasks like document summarization, text analysis, and creative writing.

This mirrors other pivotal shifts in computing. Just as processing power moved from mainframes to personal computers, and computing moved from desktops to smartphones, AI appears ready for its own transition to personal devices. Meta’s bet is that developers will embrace this change, creating applications that blend the convenience of mobile apps with the intelligence of AI.

Success isn’t guaranteed. These models still need powerful phones to run well. Developers must weigh the benefits of privacy against the raw power of cloud computing. And Meta’s competitors, particularly Apple and Google, have their own visions for AI’s future on phones.

But one thing is clear: AI is breaking free from the data center, one phone at a time.",AAPL,yes,fmp,712
2024-10-24 14:52:09,Is Apple Stock Going to $273? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/24/apple-stock-273-wall-street-analyst/,"Investors see Apple Intelligence as a major catalyst for growth in the coming years.

Despite flat iPhone sales through the first half of the year, shares of Apple (AAPL 0.36%) are trading up 22.6% year to date, slightly edging out the S&P 500 index. It seems investors are pricing in strong growth prospects as the iPhone maker rolls out its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence update for U.S. customers this fall.

Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring weighed in this week on the stock's potential by maintaining his investment firm's overweight (buy) rating on the shares with a $273 price target. With the stock already up sharply, the question is whether Apple will report better-than-expected numbers in the next few quarters to push the stock up another 16% over the next 12 months or so to reach the analyst's target.

Why is Apple stock up

Some analysts have noted encouraging delivery lead-time data for the iPhone 16 in recent weeks, but it doesn't point to significant upside to Wall Street's near-term revenue estimates (longer lead time implies greater demand for the product). The Wall Street consensus currently calls for Apple's fiscal Q4 2024 revenue to increase 13% year over year to $94 billion before accelerating to 14% year over year in fiscal Q1 2025 ending in December.

The new artificial intelligence (AI) features coming to Apple's devices are not only about selling more devices but driving more growth in services, such as App Store purchases and subscriptions. While Apple Intelligence is a free update to Apple's software, the company should see a return on investment in AI from increasing user engagement and potential new revenue-generating service offerings that take advantage of the technology.

Apple's services revenue has been the company's main growth driver, especially for earnings growth, considering the higher margins that app sales and subscriptions generate. Wall Street analysts forecast Apple's full-year revenue to increase 8% in fiscal 2025, with earnings up 12%. If it beats those numbers, Apple stock could hit Morgan Stanley's target within the next year.",AAPL,yes,fmp,426

Verizon Communications Inc VZ, AT&T Inc T and T-Mobile US, Inc’s TMUS third-quarter 2024 earnings reports revealed a trend of declining smartphone upgrade rates, raising concerns about the anticipated AI-driven super cycle.

AT&T’s upgrade rate dropped to 3.5%, down from 3.9% a year ago; Verizon’s fell to 3.0% from 3.4% and T-Mobile’s slipped slightly to 2.6% from 2.7%.

These declines came despite overall net postpaid phone subscriber growth that met Verizon and AT&T’s expectations and exceeded T-Mobile’s estimates.

While this data suggests the expected super cycle in smartphone upgrades has yet to materialize, analysts remain optimistic.

A super cycle had not been modeled for the September quarter and instead a forecast for muted iPhone revenue growth of 3%. Looking ahead, there is an expectation more robust growth of 4% in three of the four quarters in fiscal 2025, with the March 2025 quarter seeing a 7% boost due to the launch of a new iPhone SE.

The super cycle is anticipated to fully materialize in 2026, driven by the iPhone 17 and Apple’s AI advancements.

Apple is rolling out its Apple Intelligence features in phases, starting Oct. 28 with iOS 18.1, which includes limited AI functionalities.

The iOS 18.2 will follow, introducing ChatGPT integration and advanced capabilities like Visual Intelligence and Genmoji, which will further drive future sales.

Regarding current trends, IDC data shows that Apple smartphone shipments rose 3.5% year over year in the third quarter of 2024, with global smartphone shipments up 4%.

However, U.S. carrier-subsidized phone upgrades declined by around 7% year-over-year, which only partially correlates with global sales.

This trend may be influenced by Apple’s increasing use of installment plans to finance iPhone purchases, potentially reducing the impact of carrier subsidies. Despite the muted start to the current iPhone cycle, analysts believe the AI ramp will meaningfully accelerate sales within a year, with the stock likely reflecting that momentum ahead of time.

Crockett projected fourth-quarter revenue of $94.83 billion and EPS of $1.62.

2024-10-24 13:06:16,The Single Best Way To Trade Apple's Upcoming Earnings,https://www.benzinga.com/opinion/24/10/41525487/the-single-best-way-to-trade-apples-upcoming-earnings,"Apple’s (AAPL) earnings are scheduled for a week from today, on October 31 after the market closes. This presents an opportunity to swing for the fences with a cheap long strangle – that is, a long call and a long put that will deliver outsized returns if and only if traders push AAPL's prices hard in one direction or another.

Here's how to place the trade.

A trade with a long call and a long put at different strikes but with the same expiration date is called a ""strangle.""

Enter the long call and the long put, the two ""legs"" of the strangle, at the same time. But you can exit them individually without margin being necessary. In this case, however, the strangle will either hit lights out or quickly erode to zero.

With that in mind, consider this a small-sized position and enjoy any returns as a cushion for the portfolio you may be building over time.

With all that said, here's the long strangle:

If the lack of time in the options troubles you, you could take these strikes with a November 8 or 15 expiration date, but it would significantly increase the cost of the strangle. That, in turn, means the move you must see to make a profit has to be bigger, too.

The long strangle will cost 0.63 at this writing and this will be the total cost and the total exposure in the trade. The breakeven for this trade means that the price of AAPL stock will need to be above $250.63 or below $211.87.

The relative resistance zone for AAPL sits right around $250 and the relative support is near $200.

This strategy results in only two choices to exit the trade:
• Sell the entire strangle once your strikes are hit. This could be anywhere from 70-100% though if the chart really expands, the upside to profit is unlimited (theoretically).
• Sell the entire strangle once your threshold for loss is hit. Mine is typically 55%. This second one will be difficult if the traders do nothing with prices post earnings.

2024-10-24 06:45:00,1 Magnificent Stock to Buy After TSMC's Blockbuster Earnings Report,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/24/1-magnificent-stock-to-buy-after-tsmcs-blockbuster/,"The Taiwan-based foundry giant's latest results and guidance indicate that its top customer is witnessing healthy demand for its flagship product.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.78%), popularly known as TSMC, is a key player in the tech sector as it manufactures chips for several companies that serve multiple industries, ranging from smartphones to computers to data centers to the Internet of Things (IoT).

That's the reason why the Taiwan-based foundry's quarterly results can be used as a barometer to gauge the health of other companies as well. For example, Apple (AAPL 0.36%) is reportedly the top customer of TSMC's chips, accounting for 25% of the latter's top line. Apple taps TSMC's fabrication facilities to manufacture the processors used in iPhones and iPads.

That's why TSMC's terrific third-quarter results, which were released on Oct. 17, tell us that the business of its top customer is likely to be in solid shape. The Taiwanese company reported a 36% year-over-year increase in revenue to $23.5 billion, along with a 54% jump in earnings. Its results bested Wall Street's expectations, and more importantly, the guidance suggests that its healthy growth is here to stay.

TSMC now expects to finish 2024 with a 30% increase in revenue, up from its prior expectation of mid-20% growth. More specifically, the midpoint of TSMC's revenue guidance of $26.5 billion for the current quarter would translate into a year-over-year jump of 35%. This could be great news for Apple investors. Let's look at the reasons why.

The A18 and A18 Pro processors used in Apple's latest iPhone 16 models are manufactured using TSMC's second-generation 3-nanometer (nm) process node. Reports about the sales of the latest iPhones have been mixed, with some suggesting that the devices aren't selling as well as Apple had hoped for, while other reports indicate that the demand remains solid.

TSMC's latest results give us more clarity about the state of iPhone demand. The foundry giant points out that the sales of chips manufactured using its 3nm process node accounted for 20% of its revenue last quarter. That was up from just 6% in the same quarter last year. In simpler terms, TSMC sold $4.7 billion worth of 3nm chips in Q3 as compared to just over $1 billion in the same quarter last year.

Investment bank TD Cowen estimates that Apple is paying $45 for each A18 Pro processor used in the iPhone 16 Pro models, up from $40 last year. Investors should note that Apple wasn't using TSMC's 3nm technology node across all of its iPhone models last year. The iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 were using processors based on TSMC's 4nm node, while the Pro versions used the 3nm technology.

This time, all of Apple's iPhone models are powered by processors manufactured using TSMC's 3nm process node, which is one of the reasons why TSMC's revenue from this technology has increased remarkably on a year-over-year basis. There's a strong likelihood that Apple was the only customer for TSMC's 3nm chips last quarter. That's because TSMC's other key customer, Nvidia, has been using its 4nm process node to manufacture its graphics process units (GPUs).

Assuming Apple purchased all of TSMC's 3nm chips at an average price of $45 per chip, it would have procured around 100 million processors. That's around 10% higher than Wedbush Securities' estimate that Apple would be manufacturing 90 million units of the iPhone 16 in 2024.

Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan points out that the lead times of the Pro models of the iPhone 16 remain high at over 3 weeks. So, if Apple is witnessing long lead times despite an increase in production from last year's levels of 80 million units, there is a chance that its new devices are witnessing strong end-market demand.

One reason that's likely to be the case is because of an estimated installed base of 300 million iPhones that haven't been upgraded in four years. Given that Apple is now going to offer generative artificial intelligence (AI) features on its smartphones, this huge installed base of users will now have a strong reason to upgrade to Apple's new iPhones.

As such, don't be surprised to see Apple's iPhone sales figures remaining robust in the final quarter of the year. Moreover, the large installed base of aging devices should trigger an upgrade cycle which should allow the tech giant to report stronger growth in the coming year and beyond. This probably explains why analysts have increased their revenue expectations from Apple for the next couple of years.

Consensus estimates suggest that Apple ended its recently concluded fiscal 2024 (which ended on Sept. 30) with $390 billion in revenue, which would be an increase of less than 2% from the previous year. However, the chart above tells us that Apple's top line is expected to increase in the high single digits over the next couple of fiscal years.

All of this indicates that now may be a good time to buy shares of Apple before it goes on a further bull run following the 22% gains that it has clocked so far this year.",AAPL,yes,fmp,1114
2024-10-24 06:27:00,"The Race to a $4 Trillion Market Cap: Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/24/4-trillion-market-cap-apple-nvidia-microsoft/,"These three tech giants all have clear paths to the next market cap milestone, but one looks like a great bargain.

Apple (AAPL 0.36%) became the first company to top a $1 trillion market cap in 2018. Today, it remains the largest company in the world by market cap, sitting around $3.6 trillion. But it has some company near the top of the mountain.

Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%) has seen its value soar higher amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Its GPUs are essential infrastructure for companies training and running large language models. Its market cap currently sits just above $3.5 trillion as of this writing.

Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) managed to continue growing thanks to an early bet on generative AI leader OpenAI, which put its cloud computing business in an enviable position as developers and enterprises looked to take advantage of new AI capabilities. Its market cap sits at $3.1 trillion.

Because market prognosticators have a propensity for always searching out the next marker to hit, investors are likely seeing discussions about which of these companies could reach $4 trillion first (and stay there). Let's take a closer look at all three and see if an answer presents itself.

Apple took the wraps off its AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Unfortunately, all of those AI features weren't ready to go when the iPhone 16 launched in September. iPhone owners will get their first taste of Apple Intelligence at the end of October with more features coming out over the next six months or so.

Apple Intelligence includes some compelling promises that could make the iPhone a much more powerful device for productivity, communication, creativity, and general life management. But there's a big catch. It's only available on newer iPhones: the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the complete iPhone 16 lineup. As such, hundreds of millions of iPhone owners will have to upgrade their devices to get access to Apple Intelligence.

The interest in AI could lead to a so-called ""super cycle,"" driving record sales of the iPhone. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives thinks Apple could sell 240 million iPhones in fiscal 2025. Apple's already seeing relative strength in China compared to last year, and the early data from the U.S. launch were mostly positive. But it's likely to play out over the course of the year, if not longer.

A stronger-than-expected upgrade cycle and progress toward direct monetization of AI features could propel Apple's stock to the $4 trillion level. At its current price of 31.5 times analysts' consensus estimate for 2025 earnings, the stock trades at a premium to the overall market. Apple certainly deserves a premium given its massive free cash flow generation and share repurchase program. But Apple likely needs to outperform single-digit percentage revenue growth expectations for next year to justify a $4 trillion valuation.

No company has benefited more from the outsized interest in AI than Nvidia. Big tech companies are buying up Nvidia's high-end GPUs as fast as they can package them, and it doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon. CEO Jensen Huang recently said demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips is ""insane.""

That's supported by strong recent earnings results from its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.78%). TSMC expects fourth-quarter revenue to climb 35% year over year with expanding profit margins due to higher utilization of its more advanced processes. Those processes are used by Nvidia, among others, to make cutting-edge chips. TSMC also expects to spend more on capital expenditures in 2025, indicating it sees strong demand growth continuing into next year.

Nvidia's revenue is heavily reliant on just a few big companies. And those companies will be under pressure to show positive returns on their massive investments in AI data centers, including Nvidia's chips. As it stands, though, Nvidia's chips remain the best option for most of the big tech companies competing in the AI space. They simply can't afford to not buy the GPUs, as it could result in falling behind the competition.

Nvidia's current share price is about 35 times analysts' consensus expectations for next year's earnings. That's a big premium to the market, but analysts' true expectations appear to be even higher than what's printed. (After all, Nvidia's stock price has dropped in the past after the company beat expectations and provided a strong outlook.) As such, Nvidia's true multiple may be lower relative to true expectations, but it also means it must outperform significantly in order to reach the $4 trillion level.

Microsoft's early investment in OpenAI established it as a leader in artificial intelligence. Specifically, developers looking to make use of foundation models, including OpenAI's GPT, were drawn to Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure, and its capabilities.

Azure has been a growth story for Microsoft for a long time, but its growth is accelerating amid the AI boom, despite its already massive size. Azure revenue grew 29% year over year in the company's fourth quarter, faster than any of the competing public cloud providers.

Importantly, that growth looks like it will continue. Management says it expects Azure's revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the current fiscal year as it brings its capital investments of the last few quarters online. Microsoft spent $44.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2024, up 58% from the year before.

Microsoft is also integrating AI capabilities into its market-leading enterprise software, including Office 365. Its Copilot software is growing quickly, with total customers across all of its platforms increasing 60% sequentially in the fourth quarter. There's a lot of room left to grow, too, as Microsoft counted over 400 million Office 365 seats at the end of last year, and it continues to grow at a high single-digit-percentage rate every quarter.

Microsoft stock currently trades for about 32 times analysts' consensus 2025 earnings estimate, but it arguably deserves an even higher multiple as it represents the best way to play both sides of the AI coin: infrastructure and software. Its massive free cash flow from enterprise software supports reinvestment in Azure and a healthy buyback. Margins should improve over time, too, as both Azure and Copilot scale, which combined with healthy revenue growth and share buybacks should result in substantial earnings growth. Microsoft looks most likely among the three tech giants to outperform expectations, which will push it much closer to the $4 trillion milestone.

Who will win the race?

Microsoft looks most attractively priced in today's market, but it's also the furthest away from $4 trillion at this point. With a market cap of $3.1 trillion, the stock would have to climb about 29% to reach the milestone. While Microsoft's price multiple (or earnings estimates) may expand over the next few quarters as the market recognizes the attractive price, it might not be the first to $4 trillion. Still, I'd argue it's the best of the three to buy right now.

As for who reaches $4 trillion first, Nvidia and Apple are neck and neck. Either company could hit $4 trillion in just a few months if the market cooperates and they provide good earnings data or outlooks.

Apple is the safer bet to get there eventually, but Nvidia could certainly beat it to the punch if big tech reports positive earnings results with bigger-than-expected capital expenditure budgets for 2025. Nvidia could just as easily see its stock price fall considerably lower with just one bad data point in its earnings. That makes it a much riskier bet to reach and stay above the $4 trillion milestone.",AAPL,yes,fmp,1571

Warren Buffett's investing skills have made shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway a lot of money over the years. From 1965 through 2023, Buffett guided Berkshire to a cumulative return of 4,384,748%, which works out to a compound annual return of 19.8%. Most investors are fortunate if they can outperform the S&P 500's 10% average annual return by a few percent, but earning close to 20% annual returns over half a century is extraordinary.

Fortunately, Berkshire Hathaway is required to disclose its stock holdings every quarter with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 13F, so any investor can get an inside peek at the stock picks of Buffett and his investing deputies. Here are two of Berkshire's largest holdings that you can add to your stock portfolio with less than $500.

Apple (AAPL 0.36%) is Berkshire's largest holding. Warren Buffett originally invested in the stock in 2016. After a sharp climb in the stock price, the position had swelled to a stake worth $174 billion at the end of 2023, making it one of the most profitable investments of Buffett's career. Despite reducing the stake this year, it's apparent that Buffett still likes Apple's business. He noted earlier this year it was ""extremely likely"" Apple would remain Berkshire's largest stock holding by the end of the year.

Apple has built its brand around thoughtful product design that creates a seamless experience between hardware and software. It has the second most visited electronics website, according to Statista, behind Samsung. Over a third of the company's sales are made direct through one of Apple's retail stores or its website.

While some retailers are struggling with macroeconomic headwinds, Apple has continued to show strength. The company's gross profit margin for the June quarter came in at 46.3%, up from 43.3% in the same quarter two years ago. An increasing gross margin is a key indicator of a strong consumer brand.

As a manufacturer of consumer electronics, Apple is an incredibly profitable business. The company earned $101 billion in profit on $385 billion of revenue over the last four quarters. Growing sales of high-margin services continues to show that customers love using their Apple devices. Services, including App Store purchases and subscriptions, remain Apple's fastest-growing opportunity, with revenue from these sales up 14% year over year in the June-ending quarter.

Analysts are expecting an uptick in demand over the next year as customers upgrade their devices to the latest hardware to take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) features coming with the Apple Intelligence update. Apple stock has hit new highs recently but still trades at a reasonable valuation that can support solid returns for long-term investors.

Amazon (AMZN 0.78%) is another valuable brand that can help you build wealth over the long term. It stands alone in e-commerce, with $257 billion in trailing sales through its online and physical stores. Berkshire has held a stake in Amazon since 2019. Over that time, the stock has more than doubled and continues to show potential for more market-beating returns.

Convenience and selection were key factors that allowed Amazon to conquer the e-commerce market, and it continues to lean into these strengths. Amazon's total sales grew 10% year over year in Q2 while operating income nearly doubled over the year-ago quarter. The e-commerce leader is finding ways to improve shipping speed and reduce transportation costs, which is having a big impact on the bottom line. Importantly, improving retail margins are helping the company further expand its selection and solidify its lead.

Amazon's dominant online retail business has spawned other profitable revenue streams that make the stock a solid long-term investment. The company is the leading cloud services provider; that's how Amazon Web Services generates most of the company's profit. Amazon also has emerged as the leading retail media company, with revenue from advertising services coming to $51 billion over the last four quarters and growing 20% year over year in Q2.

Amazon is continuing to grow its free cash flow and sales that should lead to excellent returns for investors. The company generated $48 billion in free cash flow on $604 billion of revenue over the last year. Its ability to leverage its e-commerce dominance to develop other profitable business opportunities is why Amazon stock is worth holding for the long term.",AAPL,yes,fmp,895

China's Minister of Industry and Information Technology met with the CEO in Beijing on Wednesday to discuss Apple's development in China, network data security and cloud services, according to a ministry statement.

In the conversation, the ministry said Cook signaled Apple's commitment to the country, promising to increase investment in the market and to grow alongside Chinese companies. That same day, he met with the leaders of several local Chinese firms, including China Mobile Chairman Yang Jie, to discuss digital content and 5G product cooperation, according to local reports.

Ivan Lam, senior research analyst for Counterpoint Research, said the timing of the trip is significant, coming as local competitors are introducing updated operating systems that integrate AI and new flagship products.

""This trip seems notable now as the company could be looking to shore up collaboration with local players to launch Apple Intelligence in China,"" Lam said.

Le Xuan Chiew, Canalys' analyst focusing on Apple strategy research, said the rollout of Apple Intelligence in China was likely the main motivation for Cook's trip, which was part of efforts to ""bolster the importance of China to Apple's global strategy.""

Apple Intelligence is the company's artificial intelligence play, which aims to bring AI across its devices with features such as an improved voice assistant and tools that automatically organize emails and transcribe and summarize audio recordings.

While the company has said Apple Intelligence will roll out in U.S. English this fall, it has been more quiet on plans for the product offering in China.

During a Wednesday visit to the offices of Chinese social media giant Weibo, Cook reportedly said that Apple hopes to bring Apple Intelligence to Chinese consumers as soon as possible, but that there are strict regulatory processes it must get through, according to a local media outlet.

According to Cheiw, the need for regulatory approval could explain some of the messaging focus of Cook's China trip, though the timeline for the introduction of Apple Intelligence in China remains ""uncertain.""

This could be a problem for the company as the lack of Apple Intelligence on Chinese devices is expected to weaken the motivation for users to upgrade to the iPhone 16, he added.

Weibo is also one of the local app developers that have launched applications for Apple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which was released in the Chinese market in June.

Cook often travels to China — Apple's largest overseas market — to visit business partners, launch products and factories, and meet with local officials. During his visit in March, he had been in Shanghai for the opening of a new retail store. He also visited Chengdu this time last year as Apple faced lackluster demand in the world's second largest economy.

Apple successfully launched the iPhone 16, its latest model in the series, in China this September, and the new phones got off to a strong start. Sales were up 20% in the first three weeks since launch, compared to the 2023 model, according to data from research firm Counterpoint.

However, despite the successful product launch, overall iPhone unit sales, including older models, were down 2% year-over-year in China during the three-week period.

Apple has faced dwindling market share in China amid increased competition with local players and an increasing preference among Chinese consumers to pick domestically made goods.

The company saw its market share in the second quarter fall 5.7% year-over-year, according to Counterpoint.

After it made a splash with a surprise 5G model last year, Huawei, one of Apple's main competitors in China, launched competing handsets the same day the iPhone 16 went on sale.

""Huawei's recent resurgence in the high-end market, driven by its in-house chips and HarmonyOS ecosystem, has intensified the competitive landscape, making it harder for Apple to maintain its leadership position,"" said Canalys's Chiew.

Citing unnamed sources involved with building the Vision Pro headset’s components, a Reuters report Wednesday (Oct. 23) said that production has been significantly reduced.

A source at Luxshare, the device’s assembler, said that Apple communicated to the company “that it might need to wind down its manufacturing in November,” the report said. Another source even said their factory suspended production of Vision Pro components in May.

So far, Apple has not responded to the report.

In an April blog post, Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of worldwide developer relations and enterprise marketing, touted the device’s spatial computing for customizing workspaces, collaboration with 3-D designs, and potential for delivering specialized employee training and guiding remote fieldwork. “There’s tremendous opportunity for businesses to reimagine what’s possible using Apple Vision Pro at work,” she said.

But those tools come with a high price tag. The Vision Pro mixed reality headset starts at $3,500, compared to competitors like Meta’s Quest 3, which is priced around $500.

According to Reuters, sales dropped after an initial surge of interest when Apple launched the product in February. “Apple launched the Vision Pro in international markets earlier this year to reinvigorate demand at a time when it rushes to incorporate artificial intelligence into its flagship mobile devices to get ahead of rivals,” Reuters said.

Also, in April analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a blog post that Apple initially anticipated shipping between 700,000 and 800,000 units in 2024, but then revised that expectation down to between 400,000 and 450,000 units.

Meanwhile, other reports suggest that Apple is pivoting, perhaps working on a more affordable Vision Pro product targeted at a broader consumer base. Highlighting a post on X by Kuo, AppleInsider.com hinted that the next generation of Vision Pro will come with the AI engine Apple Intelligence.

However, Apple may have bigger problems than lack of interest in the Vision Pro. A PYMNTS report said that U.S. sales of the California-based company’s signature product, the iPhone, have “remained relatively flat since the 2020 — which is part of the reason Apple stopped reporting the number of devices sold.”",AAPL,yes,fmp,476

The CFPB statement disclosed that the tech giant and investment bank misled customers about interest-free payment plans, mishandled credit card disputes, delayed refunds and allowed incorrect, damaging information to hit customers' credit reports.

""Apple and Goldman Sachs illegally sidestepped their legal obligations for Apple Card borrowers,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in the statement. ""Big Tech companies and big Wall Street firms should not behave as if they are exempt from federal law.""

The CFPB is ordering Apple to pay a $25 million civil money penalty. Apple's fines will go toward the CFPB's victim relief fund.

""Apple is committed to providing consumers with fair and transparent financial products,"" an Apple spokesperson told CNET. ""Upon learning about these inadvertent issues years ago, Apple worked closely with Goldman Sachs to quickly address them and help impacted customers. While we strongly disagree with the CFPB's characterization of Apple's conduct, we have aligned with them on an agreement.""

Goldman Sachs is required to pay at least $19.8 million in redress in addition to a $45 million civil penalty. In addition to paying fines, the investment bank is not allowed to launch any new credit cards until it can provide ""a credit plan"" that proves it can deliver a product that follows the law, the CFPB statement added.

""Apple Card is one of the most consumer-friendly credit cards that has ever been offered,"" Nick Carcaterra, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson told CNET. ""We worked diligently to address certain technological and operational challenges that we experienced after launch and have already handled them with impacted customers. We are pleased to have reached a resolution with the CFPB and are proud to have developed such an innovative and award-winning product alongside Apple.""

Why are Apple and Goldman Sachs being fined?

The CFPB lists four areas where Apple and Goldman Sachs failed in its handling of Apple Card members:
• Failing to process or share consumer disputes: Apple neglected to send millions of customers' Apple Card disputes to Goldman Sachs, according to the CFPB. Disputes happen when a cardholder has an unrecognized charge on their account, so they reach out to the card issuer to get a charge-back.
• Failing to investigate disputes: Goldman Sachs was aware of the dispute issue and even notified Apple, the CFPB said. Neither company investigated these disputes, leaving cardholders on the hook to pay for transactions that were never reviewed.
• Misleading cardholders about interest-free payment plans for iPhones and other Apple products: Cardholders expected to automatically receive interest-free monthly payments for buying iPhones with their Apple Card. In reality, the customers were charged interest on their new purchase. In certain instances, the CFPB claims Apple did not show available interest-free financing options on specific browsers.
• Misleading cardholders about refunds: Goldman Sachs misled consumers regarding some refunds, the CFPB said, which in turn led to cardholders paying extra interest charges.

What should Apple cardholders do next?

There's nothing current cardholders need to do right now. If you suspect your credit card has been mishandled in any other ways, you can file a complaint with the CFPB.

Apple is searching for a new card issuer for the Apple Card. Last month, speculation arose that Chase was the top contender. A new issuer means the potential for new card features, rewards and perks, which is a good thing, since the Apple Card is lackluster compared to other rewards credit cards.

The Apple Card offers no welcome bonus, additional card perks or special financing plan (unless you're buying an Apple product). It does feature good rewards for Apple products, but you're likely not buying a new iPhone or MacBook every week. Its main selling point is its ability to be used with Apple Wallet, a feature many of the best rewards cards also offer.

If you're in the market for a new rewards credit card, I'd recommend choosing either the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card* or Chase Freedom Flex®* instead.

• Apple is cutting Vision Pro production, possibly halting it by year-end, The Information reported.
• Demand for the $3,500 devices has been weak, said analyst William Kerwin.
• Apple may be developing a cheaper, smaller headset to boost consumer interest.

Apple is reportedly reducing Vision Pro production, but that doesn't mean it's out of the headset game.

On Monday, The Information reported that Apple has been scaling back production of the $3,500 headset since the summertime, and it could fully stop making the Vision Pro as we know it by the end of the year.

Although Apple hasn't confirmed any changes to production, employees at Luxshare, the Chinese manufacturer responsible for assembling Vision Pros, said it's making about half as many units per day as it did during peak production, according to the report.

A representative for Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Analysts told Business Insider that they wouldn't be shocked if Apple scaled back production on the devices — but they also wouldn't be concerned by such a move.

Jacob Bourne, a tech analyst at BI sister company EMARKETER, said it ""makes sense that Apple would scale back Vision Pro production,"" citing the price point and weak consumer appeal.

Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told The Wall Street Journal that the pricey piece of tech is for ""people who want to have tomorrow's technology today.""

""At $3,500, it's not a mass-market product,"" Cook said. ""Right now, it's an early-adopter product.""

""Ultimately, we don't see this as surprising, given many reports of weaker demand for the Vision Pro and Tim Cook's recent comments about it not being a mass-market product,"" said William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar.

Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said reducing production is a ""smart strategy."" Especially if the reports of Apple working on a lower-cost version of the Vision Pro are true.

""This is all heading toward a lower-cost Vision Pro with more features that can scale,"" Ives said.

Vision Pro reviewers have criticized the headset for a lack of apps, but developers don't seem convinced that consumers will line up to spend nearly $4,000. The Vision Pro was released in February, and few, if any, apps have taken off in popularity.

Ives and Kerwin said they believe a smaller, cheaper headset from Apple could change that. Bloomberg has reported that the tech giant is working on one, and supply-chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said he predicts Apple will release ""a lower-priced version with downgraded specs.""

Kerwin said Apple's ultimate goal is likely ""a form factor closer to glasses."" Morningstar's current rating for Apple is 2 stars.

Bourne said a reduction would not indicate is Apple is ready to give up on mixed reality. He also said he predicts a pair of smart glasses on the horizon to challenge competitors such as Meta and Snap.",AAPL,yes,fmp,602

Having just issued its final rule on open banking and data sharing on Tuesday, the CFPB said Wednesday (Oct. 23) that it would fine Apple and Goldman Sachs more than $89 million for alleged customer service violations tied to the Apple Card.

Goldman will pay $19.8 million in what the CFPB termed “redress” in its announcement of the enforcement action and a $45 million fine. Apple will pay a $25 million fine, the announcement detailed.

Beyond the monetary impact: Goldman Sachs cannot launch new cards — unless it can prove to regulators that the cards are in sync with federal law.

In a statement provided to PYMNTS, Goldman Sachs spokesperson Nick Carcaterra said, “Apple Card is one of the most consumer-friendly credit cards that has ever been offered. We worked diligently to address certain technological and operational challenges that we experienced after launch and have already handled them with impacted customers. We are pleased to have reached a resolution with the CFPB and are proud to have developed such an innovative and award-winning product alongside Apple.”

An Apple spokesperson told PYMNTS via e-mail late Wednesday that “Apple is committed to providing consumers with fair and transparent financial products. Apple Card is one of the most consumer-friendly credit cards available, and was specifically designed to support users’ financial health. Upon learning about these inadvertent issues years ago, Apple worked closely with Goldman Sachs to quickly address them and help impacted customers. While we strongly disagree with the CFPB’s characterization of Apple’s conduct, we have aligned with them on an agreement. We look forward to continuing to deliver a great experience for our Apple Card customers.”

The CFPB’s investigation into Apple Card stretches back over two years; Goldman is, of course, exiting the Apple Card partnership. And as reported just last week, the Wall Street powerhouse will stop being the issuer of the General Motors GM Rewards Mastercard.

The CFPB, in its Wednesday Apple consent order filing, alleged that the two companies were tied to “customer service breakdowns and misrepresentations that impacted hundreds of thousands of Apple Card users.” The CFPB stated in its action that Apple did not send Goldman details on thousands of customer disputes; even when it did provide information on disputes, Goldman did not review them in keeping with applicable law.

“When consumers disputed Apple Card transactions via Apple’s Report an Issue functionality by completing an initial form, the disputes were initially sent to Apple, which was supposed to send them to Goldman for investigation. Beginning in June 2020, in tens of thousands of instances, Apple failed to do so,” the CFPB wrote.

The consequence, according to the Bureau, was that consumers did not get refunds in a timely manner. Other cardholders saw damage to their credit reports, as Goldman reported those consumers to credit agencies.

For disputes that did reach Goldman Sachs, the bank failed to meet federal requirements, including sending timely acknowledgment notices, conducting reasonable investigations or providing resolution letters within 90 days. These failures resulted in consumers facing incorrect negative credit reporting and being held responsible for potentially fraudulent charges.

The CFPB also charged that the companies “misled” consumers about payments for Apple products — claiming that the payments were interest free when in fact interest charges were applied. The interest-free payment options were presented only when users opted to buy the Apple offerings while using Apple’s Safari browser.

“Through at least July 2020, the checkout process … presented consumers purchasing iPhones with an option to ‘Pay in full’ or ‘Pay monthly.’ The checkout process did not explain that ‘Pay monthly’ referred to [Apple Card Monthly Installments], or provide further details about ACMI, until after consumers selected this option,” the CFPB added.

According to the CFPB, the companies allegedly proceeded with the Apple Card launch in August 2019 despite warnings to Goldman’s board of directors that critical dispute systems were “not fully ready” due to technological issues. The partnership agreement had incentivized an early introduction by giving Apple the right to impose a $25 million penalty for each 90-day delay caused by Goldman, as detailed in the consent order against Goldman Sachs.

The CFPB found a breakdown in how customer service for the Apple Card handled consumer disputes, as Apple failed to send tens of thousands of disputes to and when it did send them, the bank failed to abide by federal requirements for investigating the disputes.

The agency noted that the companies launched Apple Card despite warnings by third parties about technological issues with the Apple Card disputes system. That led to a lengthy wait for consumers to get money back from disputed charges and some had incorrect negative information added to their credit cards.

The CFPB also found that Apple and Goldman Sachs misled consumers about interest-free payment plans for Apple devices, as many customers thought they would automatically be enrolled in interest-free payments but were charged interest and in some cases couldn't see the interest-free payment option on the Apple website when using certain browsers.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Apple to pay $25 million and Goldman to pay $45 million in fines, while Goldman is also required to pay at least $19.8 million in refunds and discounts for customers. Apple failed to send tens of thousands of consumer disputes of Apple Card transactions to Goldman, which then failed to follow “numerous federal requirements” for investigating them, the agency said. Both companies also misled customers about interest-free payment plans for Apple products—including iPhones—when using Apple Cards, as many cardholders were “unknowingly charged” interest because they were not automatically enrolled in the plans, according to the CFPB. The CFPB banned Goldman from launching a new credit card until the bank “can provide a credible plan that the product will actually comply with the law.” Apple said in a statement to Forbes it disagreed with the CFPB’s claims, saying the company learned about the “inadvertent issues years ago” and worked with Goldman to “quickly address them and help impacted customers.” Goldman told Forbes the bank had “worked diligently” to address challenges surrounding the Apple Card and both companies had “already handled them.”

Apple’s shares fell nearly 1% on Wednesday to just below $233.50. Last week, the company’s stock rose to a new intraday record of $237.49 as Apple hit a market valuation of $3.61 million, the highest valuation ever recorded by a public company.

Apple launched its Apple Card credit card through Goldman in August 2019, and the bank reportedly lent out about $10 billion in credit to Apple customers within a month of its release. Apple announced discounts on its products for customers using the card, including discounts up to 6% during the holiday season. Those discounts would be applied to customers who purchased Apple products in monthly installments, which the company said would be interest-free. In 2023, Apple announced it would offer Apple Card holders a 4.15% high-yield savings account with Goldman. Goldman disclosed an investigation by the CFPB into the bank’s “credit card account management practices,” like handling refunds and billing disputes, in a 2022 SEC filing.",AAPL,yes,fmp,531

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Apple and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday to pay more than $89 million for mishandling consumer disputes related to Apple Card transactions.

The bureau said Apple failed to send tens of thousands of consumer disputes to Goldman Sachs. Even when Goldman Sachs did receive disputes, the CFPB said the bank did not follow federal requirements when investigating the cases.

Goldman Sachs was ordered to pay a $45 million civil penalty and $19.8 million in redress, while Apple was fined $25 million. The bureau also banned Goldman Sachs from launching new credit cards unless it can provide an adequate plan to comply with the law.

""Apple and Goldman Sachs illegally sidestepped their legal obligations for Apple Card borrowers. Big Tech companies and big Wall Street firms should not behave as if they are exempt from federal law,"" said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra.

Apple Card was first launched in 2019 as a credit card alternative, hinged on Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment and digital wallet service. The company partnered with Goldman Sachs as its issuing bank, and advertised the card as more simple and transparent than other credit cards.

That December, the companies launched a new feature that allowed users to finance certain Apple devices with the card through interest-free monthly installments.

But the CFPB found that Apple and Goldman Sachs misled consumers about the interest-free payment plans for Apple devices. While many customers thought they would get automatic interest-free monthly payments when they bought Apple devices with an Apple Card, they were still charged interest. Goldman Sachs did not adequately communicate to consumers about how the refunds would work, which meant some people ended up paying additional interest charges, according to the CFPB.

It also meant some consumers had incorrect credit reports, the agency said.

""Apple Card is one of the most consumer-friendly credit cards that has ever been offered. We worked diligently to address certain technological and operational challenges that we experienced after launch and have already handled them with impacted customers,"" Nick Carcaterra, vice president of Goldman Sachs corporate communications, told CNBC. ""We are pleased to have reached a resolution with the CFPB and are proud to have developed such an innovative and award-winning product alongside Apple.""

Apple said it worked closely with Goldman Sachs to address the issues when it learned about them.

""While we strongly disagree with the CFPB's characterization of Apple's conduct, we have aligned with them on an agreement,"" an Apple spokesperson said. ""We look forward to continuing to deliver a great experience for our Apple Card customers.""

2024-10-23 06:45:00,Prediction: Apple Stock Will Be Below $200 by the End of the Year,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/23/prediction-apple-stock-will-be-below-200-by-the-en/,"Reports of sales for Apple's latest iPhone release haven't been great.

Apple (AAPL 0.36%) stock is currently trading around $230, but I think it's trading on borrowed time. By the end of the year, I wouldn't be surprised if the stock was below $200, because the fundamentals don't support Apple's current stock price.

There is a lot of pressure on Apple's business, and unless something drastic changes, the stock is due for a correction.

Apple's revenue peaked in 2022 and hasn't grown since

Apple's business needs no introduction. Its devices are in the hands of millions (if not billions) of people, although Apple seems to have hit a peak in its revenue. Since 2022, Apple's revenue hasn't increased any.

Companies need growth to sustain an increasing stock price, and Apple hasn't shown that. We'll find out more about Apple's latest results when it reports on Halloween night (a scary time to report earnings!), but early indications aren't great.

Apple released the iPhone 16 during the quarter, and multiple reports have indicated that sales of the iPhone 16 aren't what the company expected. Since iPhone sales make up about half of Apple's total revenue, this segment must do well for the rest of the business to thrive. This reported weakness has caused Wall Street analysts to tweak their expectations for the upcoming quarter, as the consensus earnings per share (EPS) projection has declined from $1.60 30 days ago to $1.55 now.

Falling projections heading into earnings are never a good sign. If the rest of Apple's results aren't great, don't be surprised if the stock takes a hit, as it's trading at an incredibly pricey valuation.

Apple's stock fetches a far greater premium than most investors realize. At 35 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings, Apple's stock is very expensive.

While other stocks are trading at more expensive valuations, those companies are posting impressive growth numbers.

Over the long haul, stock price movements are heavily correlated to earnings growth. So, when a benchmark index like the S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.03%) averages a 10% return per year, that's the level of earnings growth a company typically needs to beat the market consistently, if the two securities trade at the same valuation.

Last quarter, Apple's earnings per share (EPS) grew at a 10% pace. In fourth-quarter fiscal year 2024 (ending around Sept. 30), analysts expect 14% growth. Both figures are either right at the S&P 500's long-term average or slightly higher. However, with the S&P 500 trading at 24.7 times trailing earnings and 23.8 times forward earnings, Apple holds a 43% and 32% premium to those respective valuation metrics.

Best-in-class businesses often get a premium valuation due to their execution and perceived steadiness, which Apple absolutely qualifies for. The question is, how much is that worth? I can't decide that for the market or you, but for me, the current premium Apple gets is far too high.

There are way too many stocks I can buy right now that trade at far cheaper valuations that are growing faster than Apple. Buying these stocks instead of Apple will likely boost my long-term returns, so they make for much better buys.

In the meantime, if Apple doesn't report great Q4 results, its stock could sink below the $200 mark, as its current price tag means the company must execute to perfection. Early indications are that it hasn't, and that could be the catalyst the stock needs to send it tumbling.",AAPL,yes,fmp,748
2024-10-23 05:06:00,Billionaire Warren Buffett Sold 56% of Berkshire's Stake in Apple and Is Piling Into Wall Street's Most Prominent Reverse Stock Split of 2024,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/23/warren-buffett-sold-56-apple-pile-into-stock-split/,"The Oracle of Omaha has parted with more than 515 million shares of Apple in favor of Wall Street's most unique stock-split stock.

There's arguably not a billionaire money manager that garners more attention on Wall Street than Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) (BRK.B -0.82%) chief, Warren Buffett. The accurately dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" has led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to a mouthwatering aggregate return of more than 5,600,000% since he became CEO almost six decades ago.

Riding Buffett's coattails has been a surefire long-term investment strategy. Mirroring his trades is made simple thanks to required Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the SEC. This filing provides a concise snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's best money managers are buying and selling -- and there's no 13F more anticipated each quarter than Berkshire Hathaway.

Over the last two years, Buffett and his team have been decisive net sellers of stocks. Based on the seven quarters of cash flow statements from Berkshire Hathaway (from Oct. 1, 2022 through June 30, 2024), Buffett and his top investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have sold close to $132 billion more in stocks than they've purchased.

While no Warren Buffett stock has been given the heave-ho quite like Berkshire's No. 1 holding, Apple (AAPL 0.36%), the Oracle of Omaha is finding value in Wall Street's most prominent reverse stock split stock of 2024.

Buffett has sent over 515 million shares of Apple to the chopping block since October 2023

Amid Warren Buffett's selling spree, top holding Apple has been meaningfully reduced. In a three-quarter period from Oct. 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024, Berkshire's stake in Apple declined by more than 515 million shares, or 56%, to precisely 400 million shares.

Benign profit-taking may very well be the catalyst that enticed Buffett to ring the register. During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in early May, he opined that the corporate tax rate would likely climb in the future. With his company sitting on a mammoth unrealized gain in Apple, he suggested that locking in some gains now at a lower tax rate would, eventually, be viewed favorably by Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders.

To add to this point, Berkshire's chief has continued to praise Apple's business, even as he sizably pared down his company's No. 1 position. He appreciates Apple's strong branding and the loyalty of its customer base.

Furthermore, Buffett is a big fan of what CEO Tim Cook has done for Apple. He's overseeing a multiyear transformation designed to promote Apple's higher-margin Services segment, and has spearheaded the largest share buyback program of any public company. Since initiating share repurchases in 2013, Apple has bought back $700.6 billion worth of its common stock and reduced its outstanding share count by 42.2%. This has had a decisively positive impact on the company's earnings per share (EPS).

But in spite all of these positives, Apple's growth engine has stalled. Sales of its physical devices, including iPhone, iPad, and Mac, have been weak for much of the last two years. If a growth company's sales stall, it can expose its valuation premium.

When Berkshire Hathaway's brightest investment minds, including Buffett, first purchased shares of Apple in the first quarter of 2016, it was valued at between 10 and 12 times trailing-12-month (TTM) EPS. Today, Apple is valued at almost 36 times TTM EPS, which is a level that an ardent value investor like Warren Buffett would struggle to support -- especially with the company's sales stuck in neutral.

The Oracle of Omaha's broad-based selling also alludes to the lack of value on Wall Street. This is one of the priciest stock markets in history, and Berkshire's record cash pile of $276.9 billion plainly suggests that Buffett and his team are struggling to find attractive deals... with one exception.

The Oracle of Omaha can't stop buying shares of this unique stock-split stock

Amid Warren Buffett's record selling spree, there is one stock that he and his team can't stop buying. Interestingly enough, it's also the most prominent company to have completed a reverse stock split this year. I'm talking about satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI -0.49%).

In December, Sirius XM announced plans to merge with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. Liberty Media was the majority stakeholder in Sirius XM, but its three classes of tracking stocks rarely matched the performance of Sirius XM's common stock. Combining these shares into one class ended this confusion.

Meanwhile, completing a 1-for-10 reverse split lifted Sirius XM's share price from the mid-$2s to the mid-$20s following the merger. Whereas most reverse splits are undertaken from a position of operating weakness and are necessary to avoid delisting from a major stock exchange, Sirius XM was in no danger of delisting. This split was solely designed to get its shares back on the radar of high-profile money managers who might otherwise avoid stocks trading below $5 per share.

Over the past year, Buffett and his team built their stakes in two share classes of Liberty Sirius XM Group's stock, as well as Sirius XM Holdings. Based on a Form 4 filing with the SEC last week, which detailed the purchase of an additional 1.56 million shares of Sirius XM, Buffett's company now holds more than 110 million shares. This works out to almost a third of the company's outstanding shares.

Perhaps Buffett's favorite trait about Sirius XM is that it's a legal monopoly. Though it still competes for listeners with traditional radio operators, it's the only licensed satellite-radio company. Maintaining a legal moat should afford Sirius XM meaningful subscription pricing power and lead to predictable operating cash flow.

Berkshire's top investment minds have likely also noticed that Sirius XM's sales channels give it an inherent advantage over other radio companies. Whereas online and terrestrial radio operators rely heavily on ad spending, which is highly cyclical, Sirius XM brought in 77% of its net sales from subscriptions and roughly 19% from advertising through the first-half of 2024. Subscribers are far less likely to cancel their service during periods of economic turbulence than businesses are to cut their marketing budget.

Sirius XM possesses cost advantages over its peers, too. Specifically, its transmission and equipment expenses tend to be relatively static, regardless of how many subscribers the company has. If Sirius XM can grow its subscriber count over time, this would, presumably, lead to an expansion of its operating margin.

Lastly, there's a genuine value proposition with Sirius XM stock. Shares are trading at 8 times forward-year EPS, and its roughly $1.06 per share base annual payout works out to a nearly 4% dividend yield. Sirius XM is standing out in all the right ways for the Oracle of Omaha in a historically pricey stock market.",AAPL,yes,fmp,1507

2024-10-22 15:01:32,Disney and Apple are breaking up over app store fees,https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-apple-app-store-hulu-disney-plus-2024-10,"
• Disney is breaking up with Apple — at least a little bit.
• Disney is no longer letting new customers sign up for Hulu or Disney+ via Apple's App Store.
• The move comes after Disney CEO Bob Iger complained about app-store fees.

If you want to sign up for a subscription to Hulu or Disney+, don't bother taking out your iPhone.

Disney is now telling would-be customers to pay for subscriptions on Disney's own site, instead of on Apple's App Store — though people who've already started paying for either service via Apple can keep doing that.

The two companies are still working together on some projects. But the App Store split does represent a rift between two longtime partners, so it's definitely worth noting.

Disney's rationale is clear here: When customers sign up for Disney subscription services via Apple, Apple takes up to 15% of the monthly fees those services generate. And Disney CEO Bob Iger has made it clear that he doesn't want to pay that anymore.

""We have to look at the way we're distributing,"" Iger said at an investor conference in May. ""Unlike Netflix, we distribute largely through third-party app stores. There's obviously an advantage to that to some extent, but there's a cost to that, too. And we're looking at that.""

Iger's comments didn't generate a ton of attention at the time, but in retrospect, it's easy to draw a straight line from that public positioning to now. Just like Netflix in 2018, Disney has decided that the services Apple offers through its App Store — the ability to market to and bill a giant installed base — aren't worth giving up a meaningful chunk of revenue.

But one reason I thought Iger was hoping to get a new deal from Apple, instead of an outright break, is that Apple and Disney — and Iger and Apple's cofounder Steve Jobs, in particular — have had a long-standing and public alliance.

Back in 2005, Iger let Jobs sell individual episodes of Disney-owned shows like ""Lost"" through Apple's iTunes store, which was a big deal at the time. Much more important was the deal the two men did the following year, when Disney bought Jobs' Pixar for $7.4 billion, which made Jobs Disney's largest shareholder.

Iger later joined Apple's board following Jobs' death in 2011, and the two companies have remained quite tight. Disney, for instance, last year signed on to create apps and experiences for Apple's Vision Pro headset, though it's hard to tell whether that move has helped either company.

Reps for both Disney and Apple declined to comment.",AAPL,yes,fmp,535
2024-10-22 11:10:01,Apple Intelligence will help AI become as commonplace as word processing,https://techxplore.com/news/2024-10-apple-intelligence-ai-commonplace-word.html,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

When Apple's version of AI, branded as Apple Intelligence, rolls out in October to folks with the company's latest hardware, the response is likely to be a mix of delight and disappointment.

The AI capabilities on their way to Apple's walled-garden will bring helpful new features, such as textual summaries in email, Messages and Safari; image creation; and a more context-aware version of Siri.

But as Apple Intelligence's beta testing has already made clear, the power of these features falls well below what is on offer from major players like OpenAI, Google and Meta. Apple AI won't come close to the quality of document summary, image or audio generation easily accessed from any of the frontier models.

But Apple Intelligence will do something none of the flagship offerings can do: change perceptions of AI and its role in ordinary life for a large portion of users around the world.

The real impact of Apple AI won't be practical but moral. It will normalize AI, make it seem less foreign or complex. It will de-associate AI from the idea of cheating or cutting corners. It will help a critical mass of users cross a threshold of doubt or mystification about AI to forge a level of comfort and acceptance of it, even a degree of reliance.

Generative AI has faced two problems since ChatGPT was unveiled in 2022. Many have wondered what it's really for or whether it's truly useful, given hallucinations and other issues that are rooted in training data. Others have doubted the ethics of using AI, seeing it as a form of cheating or copyright infringement.

But as we have learned in recent months, language models are most effective when they work on our own documents and data, as with platforms like NotebookLM or GPT4o, which can now handle upwards of 50 to 100 books' worth of material we upload.

The output of the prompts we run—in the form of article or lecture summaries, reports, slide decks and even podcasts—is much more accurate and useful than what came out of earlier chatbots. Apple Intelligence capitalizes on this insight by pointing most of its AI functionality at user data, rather than data on the web.

With Apple Intelligence working mainly on our own data, much of its output will likely mirror the higher quality of output we're seeing with tools like NotebookLM—compared to AI that works mainly on large bodies of anonymous training data, like ChatGPT in its early days.

Having AI work mostly on user data—and doing it frequently—will forge a new association in people's minds between generative AI and personal information, rather than miscellaneous training data. It will likely cause us to see AI as something integral to our personal routines, like reading email or the morning news.

This, in turn, will make using more powerful tools like GPT4o or Claude more socially and ethically acceptable. Once we're in the habit of using AI to summarize or edit our email, condense articles on the web into pithy summaries or edit images in Photos, we'll think less about the propriety of using NotebookLM to prepare a first draft of a memo or report, or using Dall-E to create images.

'AI for the rest of us'

Apple has a long history of making complex technologies more accessible to everyday users, and that is their goal for AI.

When word processors first appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was similar uncertainty about the propriety of using them to help us write things—a belief that something authentic or human about writing by hand would be lost.

For many, computers themselves were too daunting to embrace. But Apple's Macintosh personal computer helped domesticate and normalize using computers to write with its graphic user interface and WYSIWYG feature (""what you see is what you get""). Eventually, writing would become so closely associated with word processing that we find it hard to imagine the one without the other.

Apple Intelligence could do for generative AI what the Mac or graphic user interface did for personal computers: help tame it, and make it seem ordinary and acceptable. Apple's marketing team hints at this in their tagline for Apple Intelligence, ""AI for the rest of us.""

If history is any guide, Apple will play a key role in changing how we think about AI. Doing many of our basic tasks without it may soon seem unthinkable.

2024-10-22 05:00:00,"Prediction: 1 Unstoppable Stock Will Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club In 2025",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/22/prediction-1-stock-nvidia-apple-1-trillion-in-2025/,"This artificial intelligence company could soon join the stock market's most exclusive club.

U.S. stock exchanges are home to eight companies with a valuation of at least $1 trillion:

Apple was the founding member of the exclusive $1 trillion club in 2018. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Taiwan Semi are the newest members, having joined in the last few months. And despite only joining in 2023, Nvidia has leapfrogged tech giants like Microsoft to become the second-most valuable company in the world, thanks to soaring demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) data center chips.

I predict one more company is about to join them. Broadcom (AVGO 0.96%) has a market capitalization of $840 billion as of this writing, following an incredible 527% gain in its stock over the last five years. Like Nvidia, Broadcom is experiencing incredible demand for its AI data center hardware, and that could be the company's ticket to the $1 trillion club in 2025.

Broadcom stock only needs to gain another 19% to get there, and with two full months remaining in 2024, I'm not discounting the possibility that it could cross the $1 trillion milestone before the new year. But here's why I think 2025 is a more realistic target.

An AI company in more ways than one

Broadcom has a history of innovation that spans decades. It pioneered everything from optical mouse sensors for computers to fiber optic transmitters for data communications. However, starting in 2016, it evolved into far more than a semiconductor and electronics company.

That was the year Broadcom merged with chip giant Avago Technologies. Since then, it has spent nearly $100 billion acquiring other companies, including semiconductor equipment supplier CA Technologies, cybersecurity giant Symantec, and cloud software provider VMware. Each of them contributes to Broadcom's growing portfolio of AI products and services.

On the hardware side, Broadcom is having incredible success supplying custom AI accelerators (a type of chip used for processing AI workloads) to hyperscale customers -- which typically includes Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. During the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said sales of its AI accelerators surged by three and a half times compared to the year-ago period.

The company also supplies Ethernet switches for data centers, which regulate how quickly information travels between chips and devices. Many AI data centers cluster tens of thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) or accelerators together. High-quality networking equipment ensures developers can build AI models at the fastest speed possible, which also keeps costs down.

Broadcom said sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI Ethernet switches grew fourfold (year over year) during Q3. That isn't surprising given the strength of its accelerators business, and Nvidia's GPU business, for that matter. Tech giants are spending tens of billions of dollars building AI data centers right now, which is a powerful tailwind for Broadcom's networking equipment.

On track for record revenue in 2024, with strong growth from AI

Broadcom generated $13.1 billion in total revenue across all of its businesses in Q3, which was a 47% increase from the year-ago period. Of that, $3.8 billion was attributed to the inclusion of VMware's revenue. Broadcom closed the acquisition of that company in 2023, and only started reporting its revenue on a consolidated basis this year, which is temporarily inflating its total revenue growth.

Broadcom said AI products and services contributed $3.1 billion to its overall revenue during the quarter, and that could be the fastest-growing part of the entire organization going forward. In the upcoming fourth quarter, Broadcom expects to deliver $3.5 billion in AI revenue. This will represent a sequential increase of over 10%, compared to forecasted sequential growth of just 6.8% for its total revenue overall (which is expected to come in at $14 billion).

Broadcom is on track to generate a record $51.5 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2024. The company originally expected AI to account for $11 billion of that figure, but the segment has been so strong that management recently increased its forecast to $12 billion.

Broadcom isn't consistently profitable on a GAAP accounting basis, so we can't use the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value its stock. However, we can use the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which divides the company's market capitalization by its trailing 12-month revenue.

Based on that calculation, Broadcom's P/S ratio is currently 17.6. To be clear, that is not cheap -- it's close to double the stock's average P/S ratio of 8.9 over the last five years.

However, Broadcom's strong AI growth under the surface of its total revenue is enticing investors to pay a premium for its stock. As I mentioned, Broadcom only has to gain 19% from here to join the $1 trillion club, so if its P/S ratio remains constant, it simply has to grow its revenue by 19% in fiscal 2025 (which begins in December this year) to get there.

Wall Street expects Broadcom's revenue to grow by 17.5% in fiscal 2025, which is in the ballpark. However, since the company raised its fiscal 2024 AI revenue forecast by a whopping $1 billion last quarter alone, there is a very strong possibility that the Street's estimate for next year is low.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes data center operators will spend $1 trillion building AI infrastructure over the next five years. If he's right, I think there is a good chance Broadcom will blow away all expectations in 2025.

The key risk in my prediction is that Broadcom's P/S ratio could shrink because investors become averse to stocks with high valuations, which could add years to its journey toward the $1 trillion club. That's something to keep in mind before buying in. But as long as investors maintain a long-term horizon of five years or more, they still have the potential to do very well in this stock.",AAPL,yes,fmp,1258
2024-10-22 04:10:00,2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/22/2-warren-buffett-stocks-to-hold-forever/,"These market giants have what it takes to continue growing and delivering great long-term returns.

Warren Buffett has built a billion-dollar portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway thanks to his belief in choosing quality companies and holding on for the long term. This has helped Berkshire Hathaway deliver a compounded annual gain of nearly 20% over the past 58 years, surpassing the S&P 500's 10% compounded increase during that period. Buffett has even said that his ideal holding period for a stock is ""forever.""

The Oracle of Omaha, as he's often called, truly has followed through on that, hanging onto some of his favorite stocks as they deliver share performance and generate passive income for his portfolio over time. So, if you're looking for a couple of forever stocks, it's a great idea to consider players that Buffett has spoken highly of and held for many years. Let's check out two Buffett favorites to buy and never let go.

Buffett first bought shares of Coca-Cola (KO -0.56%) back in the late 1980s and continued adding to the position through 1994. Berkshire Hathaway spent $1.3 billion on 400 million shares -- and has held onto them ever since. Part of the reason for Buffett's loyalty to Coca-Cola has to do with the company's dedication to dividend payments and dividend growth.

Berkshire Hathaway collected $75 million in dividend payments back in 1994 and that grew to $704 million by 2022. ""Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays,"" Buffett wrote in a recent shareholder letter.

Of course, most investors don't have the resources to buy millions of shares of Coca-Cola, but even with a small investment in the company, you can gain access to recurrent and increasing passive income -- to either pocket or reinvest into this market giant. Since Coca-Cola, as a Dividend King, has lifted its dividend for more than 50 straight years, it's clear the company is committed to rewarding shareholders. (And with more than $9 billion in free cash flow, Coca-Cola has the financial resources to do so.)

Buffett also favors investing in quality companies driving the U.S. economy, and Coca-Cola, as the world's biggest non-alcoholic beverage maker, is one of them. Coca-Cola has grown revenue and profit over time and into the billions of dollars.

Today, Coca-Cola shares trade for 28x trailing 12-month earnings, a level that's remained somewhat steady over time even as revenue has climbed. So, this classic stock still makes a great one to buy and hold -- for the company's steady earnings growth and passive income potential.

Buffett shocked the market this year by selling shares of Apple (AAPL 0.36%), his biggest holding and one of his favorite stocks. In the second quarter, he reduced Berkshire Hathaway's position by 49% to 400 million shares (after cutting the holding by 13% in the first quarter). So why should you buy the stock if Buffett is selling? It's important to keep in mind the potential reason behind the move.

Earlier this year, Buffett suggested a reduction in the Apple position was linked to the possibility of an increase in the capital gains tax. So recent sales of this favorite are more linked to locking in some gains than to any change of heart concerning the company. It's also interesting to note that Buffett now holds the same number of shares in Apple as he does in longtime favorite, Coca-Cola. Does this mean Apple, originally purchased by Buffett in 2016, is settling in as a forever stock? Possibly.

The stock still remains Buffett's biggest holding in terms of value and offers many of the characteristics Buffett appreciates, such as market leadership, a solid moat, and a long track record of earnings growth.

Apple also may be heading for a new era of growth thanks to years of building a smartphone and computer empire. The company's installed base of active devices has topped 2.2 billion, and that opened the door to the selling of services, such as digital content and cloud storage, to users. Quarter after quarter, in recent times, services revenue has reached new records -- and it's higher margin than hardware revenue.

All of this makes Apple, trading at 35x trailing 12-month earnings (a reasonable price for a solid growth player), a great stock to add to your portfolio now, and like Buffett, hold onto for the long haul.",AAPL,yes,fmp,903

AAPL shares have run into resistance at a price level that was previously a peak. The odds of it staying at this level for an extended period are small. There is a good chance they either break out and move higher, or reverse and head lower.

This is why our team of trading experts has made it our Stock of the Day.

Markets are driven by supply and demand, and emotions. It’s investor or trader psychology that causes the price action to appear as a pattern on a chart.

For example, when a stock rallies to a price level that had previously been a peak or resistance, there is a tendency for it to hit resistance once again. As you can see on the chart, this is the case with shares of Apple. The $236.50 level was resistance in July and now it has become resistance again.

This isn't a random coincidence. It happens because there are traders and investors who bought shares while they were forming this top in July. After the price headed lower soon after, many of them came to believe their decision to buy was a mistake.

A number of these remorseful buyers vow to exit their positions. But they didn't want to lose any money so decided that if the shares eventually rallied back to their buying price, they would sell. This way they can get out at breakeven.

So now that Apple returned to around $236.50, they are placing sell orders. This large concentration of sell orders has created resistance at the same price that had been resistance before.

If Apple can break through this resistance, it will be a sign that the people who created the resistance with their sell orders are out of the market. They have finished or canceled their orders. This means buyers will be forced to pay successively higher prices to acquire shares and this will push the market into an uptrend.

But if the stock can't break the resistance, there is a good chance it trends lower.

Some investors and traders who want to sell may start undercutting each other. They know the buyers will go to whoever is willing to sell at the lowest price and they are concerned they will miss the trade. Other concerned sellers see this and do the same thing. It could cause a snowball effect that pushes the price lower.

When a stock reaches an important price, as Apple has, the odds are small that it will stay at it for a long time. The odds are much greater that it will soon break out and head higher, or reverse and head lower.

Despite flat iPhone sales through the first half of the year, shares of Apple (AAPL 0.36%) are trading up 22.6% year to date, slightly edging out the S&P 500 index. It seems investors are pricing in strong growth prospects as the iPhone maker rolls out its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence update for U.S. customers this fall.

Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring weighed in this week on the stock's potential by maintaining his investment firm's overweight (buy) rating on the shares with a $273 price target. With the stock already up sharply, the question is whether Apple will report better-than-expected numbers in the next few quarters to push the stock up another 16% over the next 12 months or so to reach the analyst's target.

Why is Apple stock up

Some analysts have noted encouraging delivery lead-time data for the iPhone 16 in recent weeks, but it doesn't point to significant upside to Wall Street's near-term revenue estimates (longer lead time implies greater demand for the product). The Wall Street consensus currently calls for Apple's fiscal Q4 2024 revenue to increase 13% year over year to $94 billion before accelerating to 14% year over year in fiscal Q1 2025 ending in December.

The new artificial intelligence (AI) features coming to Apple's devices are not only about selling more devices but driving more growth in services, such as App Store purchases and subscriptions. While Apple Intelligence is a free update to Apple's software, the company should see a return on investment in AI from increasing user engagement and potential new revenue-generating service offerings that take advantage of the technology.

Apple's services revenue has been the company's main growth driver, especially for earnings growth, considering the higher margins that app sales and subscriptions generate. Wall Street analysts forecast Apple's full-year revenue to increase 8% in fiscal 2025, with earnings up 12%. If it beats those numbers, Apple stock could hit Morgan Stanley's target within the next year.",AAPL,yes,eod,426
2024-10-24T00:00:00+00:00,"The Race to a $4 Trillion Market Cap: Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/24/4-trillion-market-cap-apple-nvidia-microsoft/,"These three tech giants all have clear paths to the next market cap milestone, but one looks like a great bargain.

Apple (AAPL 0.36%) became the first company to top a $1 trillion market cap in 2018. Today, it remains the largest company in the world by market cap, sitting around $3.6 trillion. But it has some company near the top of the mountain.

Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%) has seen its value soar higher amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Its GPUs are essential infrastructure for companies training and running large language models. Its market cap currently sits just above $3.5 trillion as of this writing.

Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) managed to continue growing thanks to an early bet on generative AI leader OpenAI, which put its cloud computing business in an enviable position as developers and enterprises looked to take advantage of new AI capabilities. Its market cap sits at $3.1 trillion.

Because market prognosticators have a propensity for always searching out the next marker to hit, investors are likely seeing discussions about which of these companies could reach $4 trillion first (and stay there). Let's take a closer look at all three and see if an answer presents itself.

Apple took the wraps off its AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Unfortunately, all of those AI features weren't ready to go when the iPhone 16 launched in September. iPhone owners will get their first taste of Apple Intelligence at the end of October with more features coming out over the next six months or so.

Apple Intelligence includes some compelling promises that could make the iPhone a much more powerful device for productivity, communication, creativity, and general life management. But there's a big catch. It's only available on newer iPhones: the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the complete iPhone 16 lineup. As such, hundreds of millions of iPhone owners will have to upgrade their devices to get access to Apple Intelligence.

The interest in AI could lead to a so-called ""super cycle,"" driving record sales of the iPhone. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives thinks Apple could sell 240 million iPhones in fiscal 2025. Apple's already seeing relative strength in China compared to last year, and the early data from the U.S. launch were mostly positive. But it's likely to play out over the course of the year, if not longer.

A stronger-than-expected upgrade cycle and progress toward direct monetization of AI features could propel Apple's stock to the $4 trillion level. At its current price of 31.5 times analysts' consensus estimate for 2025 earnings, the stock trades at a premium to the overall market. Apple certainly deserves a premium given its massive free cash flow generation and share repurchase program. But Apple likely needs to outperform single-digit percentage revenue growth expectations for next year to justify a $4 trillion valuation.

No company has benefited more from the outsized interest in AI than Nvidia. Big tech companies are buying up Nvidia's high-end GPUs as fast as they can package them, and it doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon. CEO Jensen Huang recently said demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips is ""insane.""

That's supported by strong recent earnings results from its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.78%). TSMC expects fourth-quarter revenue to climb 35% year over year with expanding profit margins due to higher utilization of its more advanced processes. Those processes are used by Nvidia, among others, to make cutting-edge chips. TSMC also expects to spend more on capital expenditures in 2025, indicating it sees strong demand growth continuing into next year.

Nvidia's revenue is heavily reliant on just a few big companies. And those companies will be under pressure to show positive returns on their massive investments in AI data centers, including Nvidia's chips. As it stands, though, Nvidia's chips remain the best option for most of the big tech companies competing in the AI space. They simply can't afford to not buy the GPUs, as it could result in falling behind the competition.

Nvidia's current share price is about 35 times analysts' consensus expectations for next year's earnings. That's a big premium to the market, but analysts' true expectations appear to be even higher than what's printed. (After all, Nvidia's stock price has dropped in the past after the company beat expectations and provided a strong outlook.) As such, Nvidia's true multiple may be lower relative to true expectations, but it also means it must outperform significantly in order to reach the $4 trillion level.

Microsoft's early investment in OpenAI established it as a leader in artificial intelligence. Specifically, developers looking to make use of foundation models, including OpenAI's GPT, were drawn to Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure, and its capabilities.

Azure has been a growth story for Microsoft for a long time, but its growth is accelerating amid the AI boom, despite its already massive size. Azure revenue grew 29% year over year in the company's fourth quarter, faster than any of the competing public cloud providers.

Importantly, that growth looks like it will continue. Management says it expects Azure's revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the current fiscal year as it brings its capital investments of the last few quarters online. Microsoft spent $44.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2024, up 58% from the year before.

Microsoft is also integrating AI capabilities into its market-leading enterprise software, including Office 365. Its Copilot software is growing quickly, with total customers across all of its platforms increasing 60% sequentially in the fourth quarter. There's a lot of room left to grow, too, as Microsoft counted over 400 million Office 365 seats at the end of last year, and it continues to grow at a high single-digit-percentage rate every quarter.

Microsoft stock currently trades for about 32 times analysts' consensus 2025 earnings estimate, but it arguably deserves an even higher multiple as it represents the best way to play both sides of the AI coin: infrastructure and software. Its massive free cash flow from enterprise software supports reinvestment in Azure and a healthy buyback. Margins should improve over time, too, as both Azure and Copilot scale, which combined with healthy revenue growth and share buybacks should result in substantial earnings growth. Microsoft looks most likely among the three tech giants to outperform expectations, which will push it much closer to the $4 trillion milestone.

Who will win the race?

Microsoft looks most attractively priced in today's market, but it's also the furthest away from $4 trillion at this point. With a market cap of $3.1 trillion, the stock would have to climb about 29% to reach the milestone. While Microsoft's price multiple (or earnings estimates) may expand over the next few quarters as the market recognizes the attractive price, it might not be the first to $4 trillion. Still, I'd argue it's the best of the three to buy right now.

As for who reaches $4 trillion first, Nvidia and Apple are neck and neck. Either company could hit $4 trillion in just a few months if the market cooperates and they provide good earnings data or outlooks.

Apple is the safer bet to get there eventually, but Nvidia could certainly beat it to the punch if big tech reports positive earnings results with bigger-than-expected capital expenditure budgets for 2025. Nvidia could just as easily see its stock price fall considerably lower with just one bad data point in its earnings. That makes it a much riskier bet to reach and stay above the $4 trillion milestone.",AAPL,yes,eod,1571
2024-10-24T00:00:00+00:00,1 Magnificent Stock to Buy After TSMC's Blockbuster Earnings Report,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/24/1-magnificent-stock-to-buy-after-tsmcs-blockbuster/,"The Taiwan-based foundry giant's latest results and guidance indicate that its top customer is witnessing healthy demand for its flagship product.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.78%), popularly known as TSMC, is a key player in the tech sector as it manufactures chips for several companies that serve multiple industries, ranging from smartphones to computers to data centers to the Internet of Things (IoT).

That's the reason why the Taiwan-based foundry's quarterly results can be used as a barometer to gauge the health of other companies as well. For example, Apple (AAPL 0.36%) is reportedly the top customer of TSMC's chips, accounting for 25% of the latter's top line. Apple taps TSMC's fabrication facilities to manufacture the processors used in iPhones and iPads.

That's why TSMC's terrific third-quarter results, which were released on Oct. 17, tell us that the business of its top customer is likely to be in solid shape. The Taiwanese company reported a 36% year-over-year increase in revenue to $23.5 billion, along with a 54% jump in earnings. Its results bested Wall Street's expectations, and more importantly, the guidance suggests that its healthy growth is here to stay.

TSMC now expects to finish 2024 with a 30% increase in revenue, up from its prior expectation of mid-20% growth. More specifically, the midpoint of TSMC's revenue guidance of $26.5 billion for the current quarter would translate into a year-over-year jump of 35%. This could be great news for Apple investors. Let's look at the reasons why.

The A18 and A18 Pro processors used in Apple's latest iPhone 16 models are manufactured using TSMC's second-generation 3-nanometer (nm) process node. Reports about the sales of the latest iPhones have been mixed, with some suggesting that the devices aren't selling as well as Apple had hoped for, while other reports indicate that the demand remains solid.

TSMC's latest results give us more clarity about the state of iPhone demand. The foundry giant points out that the sales of chips manufactured using its 3nm process node accounted for 20% of its revenue last quarter. That was up from just 6% in the same quarter last year. In simpler terms, TSMC sold $4.7 billion worth of 3nm chips in Q3 as compared to just over $1 billion in the same quarter last year.

Investment bank TD Cowen estimates that Apple is paying $45 for each A18 Pro processor used in the iPhone 16 Pro models, up from $40 last year. Investors should note that Apple wasn't using TSMC's 3nm technology node across all of its iPhone models last year. The iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 were using processors based on TSMC's 4nm node, while the Pro versions used the 3nm technology.

This time, all of Apple's iPhone models are powered by processors manufactured using TSMC's 3nm process node, which is one of the reasons why TSMC's revenue from this technology has increased remarkably on a year-over-year basis. There's a strong likelihood that Apple was the only customer for TSMC's 3nm chips last quarter. That's because TSMC's other key customer, Nvidia, has been using its 4nm process node to manufacture its graphics process units (GPUs).

Assuming Apple purchased all of TSMC's 3nm chips at an average price of $45 per chip, it would have procured around 100 million processors. That's around 10% higher than Wedbush Securities' estimate that Apple would be manufacturing 90 million units of the iPhone 16 in 2024.

Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan points out that the lead times of the Pro models of the iPhone 16 remain high at over 3 weeks. So, if Apple is witnessing long lead times despite an increase in production from last year's levels of 80 million units, there is a chance that its new devices are witnessing strong end-market demand.

One reason that's likely to be the case is because of an estimated installed base of 300 million iPhones that haven't been upgraded in four years. Given that Apple is now going to offer generative artificial intelligence (AI) features on its smartphones, this huge installed base of users will now have a strong reason to upgrade to Apple's new iPhones.

As such, don't be surprised to see Apple's iPhone sales figures remaining robust in the final quarter of the year. Moreover, the large installed base of aging devices should trigger an upgrade cycle which should allow the tech giant to report stronger growth in the coming year and beyond. This probably explains why analysts have increased their revenue expectations from Apple for the next couple of years.

Consensus estimates suggest that Apple ended its recently concluded fiscal 2024 (which ended on Sept. 30) with $390 billion in revenue, which would be an increase of less than 2% from the previous year. However, the chart above tells us that Apple's top line is expected to increase in the high single digits over the next couple of fiscal years.

All of this indicates that now may be a good time to buy shares of Apple before it goes on a further bull run following the 22% gains that it has clocked so far this year.",AAPL,yes,eod,1114
2024-10-24T00:00:00+00:00,The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/24/the-best-warren-buffett-stocks-to-buy-with-500-rig/,"These dominant industry leaders can grow your money for years to come.

Warren Buffett's investing skills have made shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway a lot of money over the years. From 1965 through 2023, Buffett guided Berkshire to a cumulative return of 4,384,748%, which works out to a compound annual return of 19.8%. Most investors are fortunate if they can outperform the S&P 500's 10% average annual return by a few percent, but earning close to 20% annual returns over half a century is extraordinary.

Fortunately, Berkshire Hathaway is required to disclose its stock holdings every quarter with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 13F, so any investor can get an inside peek at the stock picks of Buffett and his investing deputies. Here are two of Berkshire's largest holdings that you can add to your stock portfolio with less than $500.

Apple (AAPL 0.36%) is Berkshire's largest holding. Warren Buffett originally invested in the stock in 2016. After a sharp climb in the stock price, the position had swelled to a stake worth $174 billion at the end of 2023, making it one of the most profitable investments of Buffett's career. Despite reducing the stake this year, it's apparent that Buffett still likes Apple's business. He noted earlier this year it was ""extremely likely"" Apple would remain Berkshire's largest stock holding by the end of the year.

Apple has built its brand around thoughtful product design that creates a seamless experience between hardware and software. It has the second most visited electronics website, according to Statista, behind Samsung. Over a third of the company's sales are made direct through one of Apple's retail stores or its website.

While some retailers are struggling with macroeconomic headwinds, Apple has continued to show strength. The company's gross profit margin for the June quarter came in at 46.3%, up from 43.3% in the same quarter two years ago. An increasing gross margin is a key indicator of a strong consumer brand.

As a manufacturer of consumer electronics, Apple is an incredibly profitable business. The company earned $101 billion in profit on $385 billion of revenue over the last four quarters. Growing sales of high-margin services continues to show that customers love using their Apple devices. Services, including App Store purchases and subscriptions, remain Apple's fastest-growing opportunity, with revenue from these sales up 14% year over year in the June-ending quarter.

Analysts are expecting an uptick in demand over the next year as customers upgrade their devices to the latest hardware to take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) features coming with the Apple Intelligence update. Apple stock has hit new highs recently but still trades at a reasonable valuation that can support solid returns for long-term investors.

Amazon (AMZN 0.78%) is another valuable brand that can help you build wealth over the long term. It stands alone in e-commerce, with $257 billion in trailing sales through its online and physical stores. Berkshire has held a stake in Amazon since 2019. Over that time, the stock has more than doubled and continues to show potential for more market-beating returns.

Convenience and selection were key factors that allowed Amazon to conquer the e-commerce market, and it continues to lean into these strengths. Amazon's total sales grew 10% year over year in Q2 while operating income nearly doubled over the year-ago quarter. The e-commerce leader is finding ways to improve shipping speed and reduce transportation costs, which is having a big impact on the bottom line. Importantly, improving retail margins are helping the company further expand its selection and solidify its lead.

Amazon's dominant online retail business has spawned other profitable revenue streams that make the stock a solid long-term investment. The company is the leading cloud services provider; that's how Amazon Web Services generates most of the company's profit. Amazon also has emerged as the leading retail media company, with revenue from advertising services coming to $51 billion over the last four quarters and growing 20% year over year in Q2.

Amazon is continuing to grow its free cash flow and sales that should lead to excellent returns for investors. The company generated $48 billion in free cash flow on $604 billion of revenue over the last year. Its ability to leverage its e-commerce dominance to develop other profitable business opportunities is why Amazon stock is worth holding for the long term.",AAPL,yes,eod,895
2024-10-23T21:20:00+00:00,Apple stock slips after a big cut for iPhone 16 orders,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/apple-stock-slips-big-cut-212000986.html,"Shares of Apple (AAPL) closed down 2.16% on Wednesday after a report that the iPhone maker cut orders for its latest version by millions of units.

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the tech giant cut iPhone 16 orders by around 10 million units for the fourth quarter of this year into the first half of 2025. Most of the cuts were for non-Pro models, Kuo said, but an estimate for iPhone 16 production is now down to 84 million units for the second half of the year, compared to the previous estimate of 88 million.

Total iPhone production estimates for the fourth quarter and the first and second half of next year are all down year-over-year, Kuo said, to 80 million, 45 million, and 39 million units, respectively. Previous estimates were 84 million, 48 million, and 41 million, respectively.

iPhone revenue for Apple’s fourth quarter “may not fully reflect the impact of production cuts, as the gap between production and sell-through in 4Q23 was larger than in 4Q24, and the product mix in 4Q24 is more favorable (with increased production of the Pro Max model for Sep-Oct),” Kuo said.

But iPhone revenues will likely “come under pressure” in the first half of next year, Kuo said, because of the year-over-year decline in shipments, and “less favorable product mix” after Apple launches the iPhone SE4. Mass production of the iPhone SE4 will start in December, Kuo said, and production is expected to be 8.6 million units between then and the first half of next year.

Apple also released a new preview of its highly anticipated AI features and ChatGPT integration in the developer beta on Wednesday. Its Apple Intelligence features are expected to be released next week through the iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 software updates.

Apple (AAPL 0.36%) stock is currently trading around $230, but I think it's trading on borrowed time. By the end of the year, I wouldn't be surprised if the stock was below $200, because the fundamentals don't support Apple's current stock price.

There is a lot of pressure on Apple's business, and unless something drastic changes, the stock is due for a correction.

Apple's revenue peaked in 2022 and hasn't grown since

Apple's business needs no introduction. Its devices are in the hands of millions (if not billions) of people, although Apple seems to have hit a peak in its revenue. Since 2022, Apple's revenue hasn't increased any.

Companies need growth to sustain an increasing stock price, and Apple hasn't shown that. We'll find out more about Apple's latest results when it reports on Halloween night (a scary time to report earnings!), but early indications aren't great.

Apple released the iPhone 16 during the quarter, and multiple reports have indicated that sales of the iPhone 16 aren't what the company expected. Since iPhone sales make up about half of Apple's total revenue, this segment must do well for the rest of the business to thrive. This reported weakness has caused Wall Street analysts to tweak their expectations for the upcoming quarter, as the consensus earnings per share (EPS) projection has declined from $1.60 30 days ago to $1.55 now.

Falling projections heading into earnings are never a good sign. If the rest of Apple's results aren't great, don't be surprised if the stock takes a hit, as it's trading at an incredibly pricey valuation.

Apple's stock fetches a far greater premium than most investors realize. At 35 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings, Apple's stock is very expensive.

While other stocks are trading at more expensive valuations, those companies are posting impressive growth numbers.

Over the long haul, stock price movements are heavily correlated to earnings growth. So, when a benchmark index like the S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.03%) averages a 10% return per year, that's the level of earnings growth a company typically needs to beat the market consistently, if the two securities trade at the same valuation.

Last quarter, Apple's earnings per share (EPS) grew at a 10% pace. In fourth-quarter fiscal year 2024 (ending around Sept. 30), analysts expect 14% growth. Both figures are either right at the S&P 500's long-term average or slightly higher. However, with the S&P 500 trading at 24.7 times trailing earnings and 23.8 times forward earnings, Apple holds a 43% and 32% premium to those respective valuation metrics.

Best-in-class businesses often get a premium valuation due to their execution and perceived steadiness, which Apple absolutely qualifies for. The question is, how much is that worth? I can't decide that for the market or you, but for me, the current premium Apple gets is far too high.

There are way too many stocks I can buy right now that trade at far cheaper valuations that are growing faster than Apple. Buying these stocks instead of Apple will likely boost my long-term returns, so they make for much better buys.

In the meantime, if Apple doesn't report great Q4 results, its stock could sink below the $200 mark, as its current price tag means the company must execute to perfection. Early indications are that it hasn't, and that could be the catalyst the stock needs to send it tumbling.",AAPL,yes,eod,748

Investment research firm CFRA also raised its price target for Nvidia last week from $139 to $160. Overall, analysts see shares rising to $148.37 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Hopes are high that the market leader in AI hardware will shine in next month’s third quarter report shrugging off weakness seen in other areas of the semiconductor world.""

Nvidia is set to report its third-quarter results on 20 November.

The rise in Nvidia shares have given it a market capitalisation of $3.53tn (£2.72tn), keeping it behind Apple (AAPL) as the world's second most valuable company.

Tech giant Apple also ended Monday's session at a fresh record high, rising 1.5% to close at $236.48.

Meanwhile, positive preliminary iPhone shipment data posted by International Data Corporation (IDC) showed strong demand for Apple's previous smartphone models. Sales were also helped by Apple's rollout of the latest iPhone 16 model.

That came following concerns over weak demand for the iPhone 16, which had slightly dampened investor enthusiasm around the stock more recently.

The company debuted its Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform with a new, second-generation Oryon CPU that it called the “[f]astest mobile CPU in the world,” during its Snapdragon Summit on Monday. The new Snapdragon platform can support multimodal generative artificial intelligence features, Qualcomm said.

The new Oryon CPU is 45% faster and 44% more power efficient, according to Qualcomm, which mostly designs chips for mobile devices with the Android operating system. The new Snapdragon 8 platform could help smartphone companies compete with Apple on the AI frontier, as the iPhone maker rolls out its Apple Intelligence capabilities. Apple also has a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT-4o into the new iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.

Meanwhile, Qualcomm is reportedly interested in taking over Intel (INTC) in a deal that could be worth $90 billion, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA) reported in September. Alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) had also offered an equity-like investment in Intel that could be worth as much as $5 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Qualcomm could wait until after the U.S. presidential election next month to decide on buying Intel, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The people told Bloomberg that Qualcomm wants to see who will win the election before deciding on the deal due to the potential impacts on antitrust and tensions with China.

By taking over Intel, Qualcomm could potentially scale, gain leadership in the market for mobile, PC, and server core processor units, or CPUs, and have access to Intel’s sprawling chip fabrication plants, analysts at Bank of America Global Research (BAC) said in a note. They added that combining Qualcomm’s chip revenue of $33 billion with Intel’s $52 billion revenue would make Qualcomm the largest semiconductor company in the world.

However, the analysts said regulatory and financial challenges from a potential deal would outweigh those benefits. They are skeptical of a proposed takeover, and believe confusion over the deal could end up benefitting Intel’s rivals.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives forecasts a “robust” third-quarter earnings season for technology companies, citing artificial intelligence adoption, improved enterprise spending, and rebounding digital advertising as key growth drivers.

What Happened: In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Ives highlighted an expanding roster of companies beyond traditional AI leaders that are now capitalizing on the technology revolution.

• The Arrived Homes investment platform has created an Income Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.

While NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) are “the core drivers of AI, now we are seeing many other tech stalwarts join the AI Party,” Ives wrote, listing Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR), Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) among the companies making significant moves in artificial intelligence.

The analyst expressed optimism about the technology sector’s near-term prospects, stating, “We believe the next phase of the AI Revolution has begun.” He expects this momentum, combined with strengthening enterprise spending and a recovery in digital advertising, to push technology stocks higher through the end of the year.

This expanding AI landscape indicates a broader range of investment opportunities beyond the few companies that initially dominated the AI narrative earlier in the year, according to Ives.

But to do that, it’ll have to give consumers a reason to pony up for new phones more often.

Qualcomm (QCOM) is aiming for its latest smartphone chips to do just that, adding a number of new on-board AI capabilities it says will allow you to do things like virtually adjust the lighting in your video calls in real-time and allow your device to recognize real-world objects without having to access the web.

The Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s latest top-of-the-line mobile processor and includes improved performance and power efficiency thanks to the company’s use of what it calls Prime Cores, which are designed for high-end applications, and Performance Cores, for more casual tasks.

Qualcomm says the chips will make their way into smartphones from companies including Samsung, Xiaomi, ASUS, OnePlus, Honor, Oppo, and more in the coming weeks.

The chipmaker is promising some big performance gains from the Snapdragon 8 Elite, saying its central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) should save 44% and 40% more energy than its predecessor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen. 3, which Samsung used in its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones.

But the chip’s biggest feature is its ability to power onboard AI functions. Qualcomm says the chip will allow for things like erasing unwanted objects in videos, rather than just photos, without having to upload your movie to the cloud for processing. Instead, your phone will be able to simply remove that person who walked into the background of your shot.

The company also says OEM partners can use the NPU to expand photos beyond their borders by, for instance, increasing the background of a shot, and use the camera to interact with the world around you. For instance, you’ll be able to point your phone at an object and ask the onboard voice assistant about objects in your shot without the need to connect to the web.

Qualcomm unveiled its first-generation Snapdragon X Elite in late 2023, and Microsoft (MSFT) eventually chose the processors for its Surface line of laptops and processors, debuting the new PCs in May this year.

Onboard AI is the major common denominator between the two generations of chips. Qualcomm is working to ensure that users don’t need an internet connection to use generative AI apps and services, which could prove to be a major differentiator for new smartphones and PCs versus their predecessors.

Both the PC and smartphone industries believe AI will be the next big feature to get consumers to upgrade their devices to newer systems in the coming months and years. Still, outfitting devices with the ability to run AI apps isn’t going to get the vast majority of customers interested in spending a few hundred dollars on a new laptop or smartphone. The only thing that will do that are intriguing new apps that take advantage of AI.

Sure, more intelligent digital assistants are helpful, and improving photo and video capabilities is impressive, but there’s still no single killer app or app category that’s got people talking about wanting an AI device. My own friends and family are certainly interested in the marketing around AI products, but none of them, outside of a few early adopters and people who need the latest and greatest devices, are interested in paying up for AI just yet. That said, it’s still early in the consumer AI lifecycle, meaning there’s plenty of time for a slick new app that takes advantage of AI to come along. And when it does, we’ll finally get a sense of the appetite for AI-powered hardware. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

2024-10-21T18:13:47+00:00,Apple Holds Back iPad 11 Launch to Gear Up for AI Revolution,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-holds-back-ipad-11-181347893.html,"MacRumors recently reported that Apple(AAPL, Financial) has decided not to release the much-awaited iPad 11 in 2024 in a strategic management move. This decision appears to stem from difficulties with interacting with Apple Intelligence, the company's novel generative AI technology that requires a device utilizing an A-series or M-series hardware or better, with a powerful Neural Engine and at least 8GB RAM.

The current iPad 10, in particular, is a perfect example that can be bought for a relatively low $299 for the Wi-Fi-only model with 64 GB storage; this iPad has an A14 Bionic chip coupled with only 4 GB of RAM, which means that it can by no means have Apple Intelligence. Not even the latest iPad mini 6 with the A15 Bionic chip and the same amount of RAM as the supposed iPad 10 has been omitted due to outdated components.

This may be due to the criticism iPhone 15 and 15 Plus users had given in when they were unhappy to find out that they bought quite expensive devices barely a year ago that would not be able to support the new AI features. Seeing how the company is still in the process of implementing the first applications of generative AI, it only makes sense that Apple is wary of causing any more disconnection with audiences.

Market analysts believe that Apple could have used the time to refine the physical internal mechanics of iPad 11 and, in a similar vein, beef up the hardware specifications of the device in the same way they have done the iPad mini 7, recently introducing an A17 Pro chip and 8GB RAM. This delay could not only help Apple gain the degree of flexibility that might allow it to tweak its pricing tactics but could also help to ensure that its next-generation iPad is ready to unlock generative AI's full potential.

Market Cap Hits $3.4 Trillion,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-next-most-valuable-company-172133666.html,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) is poised to challenge Apple's (AAPL, Financial) market position as its market capitalization reached an impressive $3.4 trillion, following $3.5 trillion, a figure currently held by Apple. This surge of Nvidia towards a $3.5 trillion market cap is supported by significant investments in Nvidia's AI-centric GPUs by major tech firms such as Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) and Amazon (AMZN, Financial). Recent financial results also show the demand growth for the company's AI chips, including its latest products that are pivotal in AI computing and architecture. Since deep learning has become more and more significant in the artificiafirm's intelligence sphere, Nvidia has had stable growth and can be considered to be a competitor to Apple, becoming the most valuable company in the world. Based on these factors, Nvidia is in a strategic place in the AI hardware business, with good growth and solid financials. This stock could forcefully take on the leadership position of Apple as the most valuable company.

This competitive advantage is further strengthened by Nvidia's engagement as a forward-thinking company in the next generation of AI innovation, complemented by increased research and development spending in advanced machine learning tech and improving data center solutions. This is coupled with the company's focus on sustainability and ethical ways of using artificial intelligence, which is a trend internationally. This primary source shows how the company's context of market dynamics today and how its strategic adaptation to the future demands of such markets not only strengthens its market position but also positions it as the primary driver of the future of technology.

2024-10-21T16:39:00+00:00,The 4 words Tim Cook uses to defend Apple's late AI start,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/4-words-tim-cook-uses-163900267.html,"Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook doesn’t seem to be too worried about the iPhone maker’s late start on artificial intelligence.



“Not first, but best,” Cook — and other executives — told the Wall Street Journal about Apple’s AI strategy in an interview published Sunday.

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant unveiled its AI initiative, Apple Intelligence, this past June. While OpenAI launched its popular generative AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022 — followed by Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta’s (META) flurry of chatbots, custom AI chips, and AI software features — Apple stayed quiet.

But according to Cook, who has been at Apple’s helm since 2011 after Steve Jobs resigned, the company was looking to perfect its suite of AI tools — rather than win a mad dash to a not-yet-existent finish line.

“We’re perfectly fine with not being first,” he told the Wall Street Journal. “As it turns out, it takes a while to get it really great. It takes a lot of iteration. It takes worrying about every detail. Sometimes, it takes a little longer to do that.

“We would rather come out with that kind of product and that kind of contribution to people versus running to get something out first. If we can do both, that’s fantastic. But if we can only do one, there’s no doubt around here. If you talk to 100 people, 100 of them would tell you: It’s about being the best.”

But even the rollout of Apple Intelligence has faced delays: It didn’t come pre-installed to the new iPhone 16 lineup, as new software usually does, but is instead going to be introduced as a software update later this month. 



Apple Intelligence includes a slate of new features for iPhone 15 Pro models and higher, including the ability to understand and create images and language; edit, change tone, and proofread text; and create new emojis using a typed description. Voice assistant Siri will also become more natural, relevant, and personalized and will allow users to access ChatGPT directly from their devices.

While analysts have hoped the new features would drive a so-called upgrade “supercycle,” Jefferies (JEF) analysts warned in a note Sunday that they likely won’t significantly boost iPhone sales this quarter.

Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said in June 2023 that it had uncovered an American espionage operation that compromised thousands of iPhones using sophisticated surveillance software, an allegation Apple denied.

The Kommersant newspaper last year reported that the Kremlin had told officials involved in preparations for Russia's 2024 presidential election to stop using iPhones because of concerns the devices are vulnerable to Western intelligence agencies.

Vedomosti, citing an unnamed representative of the Tenderplan trading platform, said the value of contracts involving iPhones for the first three quarters of the year amounted to 6.9 million roubles ($71,469), up from 1.6 million roubles the year before.

Reuters could not independently verify the data. Russia's digital ministry last year banned employees from using iPhones and iPads for work emails and applications. The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The latest iPhone 16 is on sale and in high demand in Russia, despite Apple halting exports to Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.

Apple Intelligence, as the suite of features are known, are the Cupertino, California-based company’s first and highly-anticipated foray into AI. But a delayed rollout and a global slowdown in smartphone sales for the quarter put a damper on hopes that the iPhone maker could see an uptick in upgrades.

The tech giant could add Apple Intelligence to iPhones — specifically iPhone 15 Pro models or newer — on Oct. 28, in a software update that will give users their first look at what Apple’s version of AI will be capable of. But Analysts at Jefferies (JEF) warned in a research note published Sunday that this likely won’t give iPhone sales a boost.

Read more: Apple is losing to Huawei in China. Here’s why

Jefferies said the upgrades, which will include limited hardware capabilities and a relatively small AI model, “are not significant enough” to improve iPhone sales.

The research firm expects an incremental rollout of Apple Intelligence features in subsequent software updates over the next six months, with a big step up in AI capabilities on the iPhone likely not on the horizon until 2026.

Sales for the new slate of iPhones largely disappointed, growing just 1% year-over-year for the current quarter, according to Jefferies’ note citing market research data from Counterpoint. That’s including the fact that iPhone 16 deliveries began two days earlier than last year.

Overall, global smartphone sales rose just 2% in the quarter, down from 6% growth in the second quarter of the year. Paired with rising costs for hardware related to AI, Jefferies said it is expecting overall downward pressure on smartphone deliveries and sales to continue through the end of this year.

While analysts initially touted the growth opportunities and the potential for an upgrade “super cycle” for Apple, recent research shows that a minority of consumers buy a new iPhone because of new features. Most only opt to upgrade their smartphones once they become obsolete, or are stolen or damaged.

The company, too, was hoping Apple Intelligence would help drive sales. It reported sales of almost $86 billion for the quarter ended June 29, up 5% from a year earlier and topping Wall Street estimates. But the company continues to face growing competition in China, including from homegrown smartphone maker Huawei, which has continued to be a drag on its sales.

Apple is set to report earnings on Oct. 31.

2024-10-21T11:54:46+00:00,Microsoft deploys AI bots to free workers from routine tasks,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ai-bots-worker-admin-115446617.html,"Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft (MSFT), has compared the transformative potential of AI with the industrial revolution, as the company launched new tools designed to help businesses streamline operations.

Speaking at Microsoft's AI Tour event in London, Nadella said the goal is to “empower people to do things that they couldn’t do previously.”

One of the leading investors in AI, Microsoft announced the rollout of its Copilot AI features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. These AI tools, known as autonomous agents, are custom-built applications that can handle specific tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more strategic work.

During the event, Microsoft showcased examples of how Copilot is already being used in business processes. Consultancy firm McKinsey & Company, for instance, is using Copilot to automate responses to client requests. The AI-powered tool extracts key information from emails, such as the client’s name, company, and the nature of the proposal. It then cross-references it with relevant data and forwards the details to the appropriate expert. McKinsey estimates that the tool could reduce the time partners spend managing client engagements by 30%.

These autonomous agents can be built with Microsoft’s Copilot Studio using low-code or no-code instructions, allowing users to create AI-driven workflows without requiring extensive technical expertise.

For example, businesses can instruct an agent to sort and process incoming emails and specify how the AI should respond to missing or incomplete information. Employees can also oversee the AI's work to ensure accuracy and correct any errors, known as ""hallucinations.""

Microsoft’s broader AI strategy is closely tied to its significant investments in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. The tech company envisions a future where AI-powered agents are found everywhere in the workplace, functioning autonomously or responding to user prompts. Nadella described these agents as the ""new apps for an AI-powered world.""

William Hewish, UK-based Pets at Home (PETS.L) CIO, said AI has helped staff focus on more complex tasks by handling time-consuming data collection. The company’s profit protection team, for instance, uses AI to assess potential profit loss cases more efficiently, allowing them to focus on skilled analysis rather than basic information gathering.

The new software will be available for public preview next month.

The announcement comes only weeks after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticised Microsoft’s Copilot, likening it to the infamous Clippy assistant from the 1990s and claiming it fails to deliver meaningful value. “It doesn’t work,” Benioff said, adding that Salesforce’s (CRM) own AI tool, Agentforce, can handle trillions of transactions per week and offers a more impactful solution for businesses. Microsoft, which has consistently ranked among the world’s most valuable companies, is locked in a race with Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) to become the first company to reach a $4tn market capitalisation. Since Nadella took over as CEO, Microsoft’s stock price has more than doubled, driven by a shift in focus toward cloud computing, cross-platform technologies, AI, and emerging fields such as quantum computing. Nadella has moved the company away from its former reliance on Windows, scrapping its failed mobile phone division and pushing into new technologies that he hopes will define the future of computing.

According to Ark Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence breakthroughs are expected to increase the share of the global equity market associated with disruptive innovation from 16% to 60% by 2030. With inflation transitioning to deflation in several sectors, the firm believes that five innovation platforms, namely robotics, energy storage, AI, blockchain, and multi-OMIC (biological analysis) sequencing will be profoundly impacting macroeconomic metrics over the next few years.

One of the firm's ETFs with the investment theme of next-generation internet outperformed broad-based global equity indices in the third quarter, benefiting from its holdings in companies involved in innovative technologies. The year-to-date performance of the fund is 16.81%, outperforming its category by 1.59 percentage points year-to-date.

In light of this trend, joining CNBC’s “The Exchange”, technology reporter Kate Rooney revealed how Wall Street is trying to cash in on the AI craze using AI itself. According to Rooney, the new world of generative AI is starting an “arms race for hedge funds”. Modern versions of AI today are better than human traders in ways more than one. They learn from mistakes and get smarter along the way, and they ultimately require minimal human intervention. Combining this with the rise of OpenAI and Anthropic, these “off-the-shelf” models tend to be cheaper.

Moreover, while human traders may be capable, they often succumb to emotions and tend to make mistakes. This is why Intelligent Alpha CEO Doug Clinton believes that a “lack of emotion” is actually the edge or “superpower” of AI. That said, the program revealed how hedge funds are now looking into AI to “get ahead of the markets”, where their use of AI will ultimately help them improve decision-making in the field. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised significant capital along the way, ultimately need enterprise clients to scale, and Wall Street is an ideal fit due to its reliance on data and analysis.

Intelligent Alpha has launched a first-of-its-kind ETF named after famed stock trader Jesse Livermore. The ETF uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini to construct a global equity portfolio. As per Clinton, firms that get on board with AI could gain an edge with a price tag of millions of dollars. “What it does is it adds some intelligence to indexes, which are just definitionally sort of a set of rules that can’t be smart. And they also take that emotion out of the active side where human beings are still making decisions, but we get caught up. You know, we make mistakes and sometimes those compound. And so I think by fixing those two issues, AI has the potential to really capture a lot of value in terms of assets flowing to these new AI-powered funds.” - Intelligent Alpha CEO Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.

2024-10-21T00:00:00+00:00,Did Warren Buffett Just Make a $16 Billion Mistake?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/21/did-warren-buffett-just-make-a-16-billion-mistake/,"Berkshire Hathaway's decision to sell Apple shares has caused some to scratch their heads.

Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B -0.82%), is widely recognized as one of the greatest investors of all time. He's also one of the biggest evangelists for investing in the stock market. Buffett is an eternal optimist and a cheerleader for the U.S., saying that the newest babies in the country are the luckiest to have ever been born. He has encouraged buying stock in funds that mirror the S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.03%) because he believes investing in America has always been a smart move.

And yet, even with the roaring bull market this year, Buffett has pulled back on buying stocks. As a result, Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of equities. On Berkshire's balance sheet, its investments in equity securities declined by $69 billion, while investments in Treasury bills jumped by $105 billion, showing a rotation to safety. Some market analysts have interpreted those moves as a sign of Buffett's caution about the current market. Stocks are indeed expensive by historical averages, and Buffett has bemoaned the high valuations of equities, which have prevented his company from making an acquisition for quite some time.

Berkshire's stock moves always attract attention because of Buffett's stature. In particular, the conglomerate's decision to sell much of its stake in Apple (AAPL 0.36%) this year caused some to scratch their heads.

After all, Buffett has sung the tech giant's praises on multiple occasions, but Berkshire's sales of some of its Apple stock meant Berkshire lost out on billions in gains the stock has made since the sale. Did Buffett make a big mistake? Let's take a closer look.

Berkshire began buying Apple stock in 2016. At one point it owned roughly $175 billion worth of the iPhone maker. But Buffett's conglomerate has sold stock over the last three quarters, through the second quarter of 2024. (It hasn't reported its third-quarter trades yet.) The company sold 10 million shares of Apple in the fourth quarter of 2023, 116.2 million shares in the first quarter this year, and another 389.4 million in the second, leaving it with 400 million shares of the iPhone maker.

We don't know exactly what prices Berkshire sold Apple for, but using the quarter-end share price for each of those sales, we can estimate that Berkshire has lost out on roughly $16 billion in gains since the sale by selling when he did.

Even as Berkshire reduced its exposure to Apple, shares of the tech company have continued to rally to a new all-time high on enthusiasm for the iPhone 16 and the new Apple Intelligence AI platform.

Buffett hasn't said much about why he cut Berkshire's exposure to Apple, though he did allude to the risk of an increase in the capital gains tax rate at the Berkshire shareholder meeting in May. While that possibility was discussed in Washington last year, it seems like less of a risk now with a new administration coming into the White House.

Apple isn't the only stock Berkshire has been selling, either. Buffett also sold shares of his favorite bank stock, Bank of America. Berkshire sold roughly $10 billion of BofA stock, starting in the third quarter, and it likely lost additional gains on those sales as well, since that stock now trades near its 52-week highs after a solid earnings report.

Was it a mistake or a warning?

At current stock market levels, Berkshire's sales of Apple (and, to a lesser extent, Bank of America) look like a mistake, but Buffett is known for his contrarian thinking.

One of his best-known quotes is, ""Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy."" With the S&P 500 having just posted its best performance in the first nine months of the year in nearly 30 years, it's understandable for Buffett to take a cautious approach.

However, there are lots of signs that the bull market could have plenty of room to run. Tech bellwether Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing just jumped based on a strong earnings report and said AI demand would continue for many years, and Nvidia's CEO recently said demand for its new Blackwell platform was ""insane."" Meanwhile, the Fed has initiated actions that are likely to lead to lower interest rates, which is typically bullish for stocks.

We'll have to wait a few more weeks to see if Berkshire continued to dump Apple stock in the third quarter, but for now, that decision looks like a costly mistake.",AAPL,yes,eod,942
2024-10-21T00:00:00+00:00,"As iPhone Sales Soar in China, Is It Time to Buy Apple Stock?",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/21/as-iphone-sales-soar-in-china-is-it-time-to-buy-ap/,"The iPhone 16 could help turn around Apple's weakest market.

Apple (AAPL 0.36%) received some good news recently when it was reported that the company is seeing strong iPhone growth in China. According to data from Counterpoint Research, through the first three weeks since its launch, iPhone 16 sales have increased 20% in China versus last year when Apple introduced the iPhone 15.

On top of that, the report says that the mix of iPhones has also been favorable. According to Counterpoint, sales of pricier iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models have increased even more, jumping 44% compared to the iPhone 15.

This is big news for Apple and its shareholders, as the company has struggled in the country recently.

China has been a sore spot for Apple recently, with the geography by far its worst performer this year. Through the first nine months of its fiscal year, Greater China sales have declined nearly 10% to $51.9 billion. Meanwhile, sales were down about 6.5% in China for its most recent quarter.

Notably, this hasn't been an industry problem, as in Q2 China saw smartphone growth accelerate to 8.9%, according to IDC. Chinese domestic smartphone makers Vivo, Huawei, and Xiaomi all saw strong double-digit unit growth.

Apple, meanwhile, fell to the No. 6 spot in market share by shipments in Q2, despite offering price promotions to help drive unit sales. Overall, its unit sales fell by 3.1% in the quarter.

At about 17.5% of its sales this year, China remains an important market for Apple. The big jump in iPhone 16 sales and preference for its Pro models is thus good news for the company. The iPhone has lost its luster as a must-have luxury brand in the country, but its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered iPhone is clearly gaining some strong early interest.

What's really interesting, though, is that the Chinese version of the iPhone 16 currently doesn't support the Apple Intelligence feature in the Chinese language, and it isn't expected to be added until 2025. The company is also not sure when or if it will be supported in mainland China, and has been looking to partner with a local tech company to bring AI features to mainland China customers. However, Chinese buyers have been flocking to the smartphone nonetheless. If Apple is able to introduce AI features in China in 2025, it could really boost sales next year in this market.

The strong initial iPhone 16 sales weren't the only good news out of China for Apple. The company also struck a deal with China Mobile, home to 1 billion wireless subscribers, to give them access to Apple Music. Apple is currently the only Western music company operating in China, and while there is fierce local competition, this could be another nice opportunity.

While the early strong sales in China are a positive sign for that market, it could also be an overall good omen for global demand. After all, the iPhone 16 is hot in a struggling market where its main selling feature is not yet even currently available.

Apple is betting on the iPhone spurring a hardware upgrade cycle, in which people upgrade their devices in order to be able to use the latest AI features. As the largest contributor to its sales by far, an iPhone upgrade cycle could be a major driver of revenue and profits. The analyst consensus is for Apple to sell 234 million iPhones in fiscal 2025, which is only a 4% increase over fiscal year 2024 expectations and a similar rate to sales in recent years.

As such, a more pronounced upgrade cycle could go a long way in helping Apple top these estimates. However, this is not the only way in which the company should benefit from an iPhone developed to run AI. It should also benefit from the sale of AI-powered apps, for which it gets a 30% cut on sales from developers in most regions. This is the fastest-growing and higher gross margin part of Apple's business, and as app developers introduce AI-powered apps, it should see a nice boost to profits.

Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times based on next year's analyst estimates, Apple is trading toward the end of its valuation range.

However, Apple has become of the largest companies in the world for a reason, as it has a very sticky business and is viewed as a luxury brand. Its closed-loop system, meanwhile, gives the company a powerful and growing stream of high-margin service revenue that just compounds over time. AI is likely only going to help accelerate this.

As such, Apple should continue to be a long-term winner for investors.",AAPL,yes,eod,956
2024-10-20T19:19:00+00:00,Could Buying Apple Stock Today Set You Up for Life?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-buying-apple-stock-today-191900728.html,"If you bought Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock 10 years ago and held on, you'd be a pretty happy investor. Over the past decade, the stock has generated a nearly 800% return. As a result, a $50,000 investment would be worth about $450,000 today.

Apple is a tremendous story. The company was once on the brink of bankruptcy only to become one of the largest companies in the world. Now you may think given Apple's current size that the stock won't be able to turn in the same type of performance as it has the past decade. However, there are a few things to keep in mind.

One is that Apple's 10-year performance came when it was already the largest company in the world at the start of this period. Second, all of this outperformance occurred years after founder Steve Jobs had passed. With that in mind, let's look to see if an investment in Apple can set you up for life.

Reasons to be bullish on Apple

While Apple is best known for its popular iPhone, the real driving force behind its business in recent years has been its service business. Powered by its app store, Apple gets a piece of nearly every dollar spent through the platform. Currently, it gets up to 30% of every sale on its platform in most regions, or 15% from smaller developers.

While that may sound like a lot, it's similar to other distribution models. For example, Roku takes a 20% to 30% cut for streaming channels on its platform (excluding Netflix), while markups on certain goods from retailers can be quite high. However, the beauty of Apple's model is that its app store has very low overhead costs for app distribution.

As such, this leads to a very high-gross-margin business. Last quarter, its services business had 74% gross margins versus 35% gross margins for its product business. Its services segment includes other attractive high-margin businesses, such as Apple Pay, Apple Care, and cloud services, where users pay to get more storage on their devices. It is also home to Apple TV and Apple Music, which likely carry much lower margins due to content costs.

Apple has been able to become one of the world's most valuable companies by creating a walled-garden system over which it has a lot of control. This not only helps it create a smooth experience for users, but also a very sticky one. Once part of the Apple ecosystem, users tend to stay. As such, even as device sales have struggled recently, its high-margin service revenue has been still growing nicely, as evidenced by the 14% increase in revenue it saw last quarter.

Moving forward, Apple should have a nice opportunity with artificial intelligence (AI). This likely happens in two main ways. The first is that AI should spur a hardware upgrade cycle in the coming years as consumers upgrade their iPhones to newer models to run AI applications. Second, as users buy more AI-related apps from the app store, Apple should see a nice boost to revenue and profits.

An investment in Apple is not without its risks. The company has the potential to lose out on a big chunk of high-margin revenue it was getting from Alphabet to use Google as its default search engine on its devices. Alphabet recently lost an antitrust lawsuit, and one of the government's big contentions was the agreement between the two companies. The Google deal has been estimated to be as high as $25 billion a year from analysts at Jefferies, as Alphabet was paying Apple 36% of its search revenue that originated from Safari to be the exclusive search engine for the web browser. While that is only about 6% of Apple's revenue, it is pure margin, so it has been projected to be nearly 20% of its operating profits. The final remedy of the Alphabet antitrust case is still unknown, but the exclusive search deal between Apple and Alphabet will likely be impacted. I wouldn't expect all of this revenue to go away. There could still be a non-exclusive revenue share deal between the two, and it is likely that most users will stick with Google Search as their default, given the alternative options. In this scenario, maybe Alphabet pays a smaller percentage, or maybe it doesn't. Meanwhile, any other search providers would also likely have to pay a percentage of their search revenue as well. Apple could also opt to use an internally developed search engine and keep all the ad revenue generated from searches on its devices. While the company prefers to use Google, the internally developed option can be used if it is not getting paid enough money due to losing its exclusive deal. Apple has been rumored to have been working on a search engine for a couple of years. If true, it could, at the very least, use this as leverage when negotiating non-exclusive deals. Apple also faces a regulatory risk to its App Store business as well, as companies have complained about the cut the company takes. However, the tech giant has won lawsuits in the U.S. in the past and has come up with creative ways to keep app developers from using third-party app stores in Europe, after the European Union forced it to open up its business. This included charging third-party app stores a core technology fee of 50 euro cents ($0.54) per user per year. In addition, app developers that have more than 1 million installs per year would have to pay the same fee for every new install over 1 million. That can add up to a lot of money fast. While Apple is facing some risks, the company has shown to be resourceful in the past and should be able to mitigate anything that comes it way. The stock has been a long-term winner for a reason, and I don't see that changing. Meanwhile, AI could be the next catalyst to drive the stock higher. While Apple's stock by itself may not set you up for life moving forward, it can still be a solid core position in your portfolio.

(AAPL): Innovating Through Challenges and Opportunities,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-innovating-challenges-191034004.html,"We recently published a list of 7 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024.

The tech sector has been showing positive performance amid market concerns, driven by improved earnings estimates and substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Approximately 40% of operating cash flow is currently allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will begin to yield returns. The strong profit margins of mega-cap stocks, averaging over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors, suggest continued capital inflows into tech companies demonstrating earnings strength. While some consolidation and growth slowdown may occur, there is confidence that investor sentiment will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.

As sentiments shift regarding major tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining positive momentum in the market. There was a conversation regarding this, covered a few days back in our article about the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In, where Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, discussed the tech sector’s mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Here’s an excerpt from his sentiment:

Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on October 17 and highlighted that there’s a likelihood that the markets could move into choppier territory. Katie Stockton characterized her stance as neutral regarding the indices despite the strength of the trend and the participation of most stocks on the upside. She noted that while short-term momentum is currently positive, particularly behind major indices, there are concerns about potential problems if key players like NVIDIA falter. She highlighted that sentiment appears overly bullish or greedy, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index reaching an extreme level of 5%. This situation makes it challenging for the market to sustain overbought conditions, which are prevalent across various timeframes.

Stockton anticipates a pullback or possibly a more significant corrective phase in the fourth quarter for the S&P 500, suggesting that this could mark the beginning of a range-bound environment. She pointed to indicators such as the VIX, which has entered a new higher volatility cycle, and mentioned signs of long-term exhaustion indicated by the DeMark indicators, levels not seen collectively since late 2021. While this does not necessarily signal an impending bear market, it does enhance the likelihood of experiencing a choppier trading environment. When asked about the recent performance of banks and cyclical stocks compared to defensive stocks, Stockton acknowledged that while there has been a positive move from the financial sector contributing to the S&P 500’s recent gains, it is too early to conclude that this represents a breakout in relative strength for financials. She indicated that most metrics suggest financials will likely perform in line with broader market trends rather than leading them. Furthermore, she expressed concern that mega-cap sectors are poised to lose their leadership position, which could pose challenges to overall market performance. Regarding small-cap stocks, Stockton noted that while the Russell 2000 index made another attempt at an upside move, closing close to 2,300 with a 1.6% increase, long-term trends still indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500. She pointed out that there has not been a breakout in the Russell 2000, which remains stalled below resistance levels established during summer highs. Consequently, she does not see actionable opportunities in small caps at this time and anticipates neutral trading conditions for this segment. On the topic of bonds, Stockton mentioned that Treasury yields have shown some upside momentum but backed off recently. She sees potential entry points in Treasury bond proxies like TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), suggesting signs of short-term downside exhaustion within a broader long-term uptrend for fixed income. She believes there is an opportunity for investors to enter Treasury bond proxies now, while also expecting yields to stall without significant long-term declines. Her insights highlight her focus on maintaining balance amid prevailing uncertainties in both equity and bond markets. To find the best American stocks, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Apple Inc. (AAPL): Innovating Through Challenges and Opportunities A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells personal computers, smartphones, tablets, wearables, and various accessories and software, best known for its iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. Its focus on user experience, innovative design, and ecosystem of products and services has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world. The company’s FQ3 2024 revenue rose 4.87% as compared to the year-ago period, with services reaching a record $24.2 billion, up 14%. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, while Mac and iPad revenue grew 2% and 24%, respectively. iPhone 16 shipments are lower than last year, with shorter wait times for Pro Max models. Initial iPhone 16 series pre-orders are down 12.7%. Overall, iPhone 16 Pro models have largely met expectations but the base model and 16 Plus have not matched last year’s figures. Despite initial iPhone 16 demand concerns, the company’s stock rose 3% in two days, reaching its highest close since July, as reported this Tuesday, October 14. Analysts are optimistic about Apple Intelligence’s potential to drive a “stronger-for-longer” upgrade cycle, with price targets reaching $265. However, recently, Huawei has surpassed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the leading smartphone brand in China, driven by factors such as nationalism, economic conditions, and trade restrictions on Huawei, causing sales to decline for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Its AI tool, Apple Intelligence, could boost demand in the US market. Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates raises concerns about the impact of Apple Intelligence on device upgrade cycles. Despite potential challenges related to iPhone upgrade cycles and the services business, strong brand recognition, innovative product lineup, and expanding ecosystem position the company for continued growth. Vltava Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “You probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire’s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett’s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire’s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.” Overall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(AAPL) the Best IoT Stock To Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-best-iot-141334556.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other IoT stocks.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network connecting physical objects to the internet. Industries are embracing IoT technologies for applications like smart manufacturing and supply chain management. Enterprise IoT spending is expected to slow down in the second half of this year due to economic concerns which will affect corporate spending in general. However, corporate spending on IoT will rebound in 2025. The global market for IoT is expected to grow at a rate of 24.3% annually between 2024 and 2032. In 2032, it is expected to reach a value of $4,062.34 billion.

The rise of smart homes, buildings, and manufacturing, along with advancements in smart infrastructure, is driving significant growth in the IoT market. Moreover, smart city initiatives are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing population and expansion of cities. Consumers are adopting smart city solutions, including smart utility meters, transportation, waste management, grids, and air quality controllers.

IoT adoption is also growing rapidly in other sectors, particularly healthcare. The global IoT in healthcare market is projected to expand significantly and reach $952.3 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%. IoT is a major force behind healthcare's digital transformation, revolutionizing the way medical data is collected, analyzed, and used. This is leading to better patient care, greater operational efficiencies, and innovative treatments.

IoT is also seeing increased adoption in warehouse management. The global IoT warehouse management market is projected to grow from $14.8 billion in 2023 to $57.2 billion by 2033, reflecting a CAGR of 14.5% over the next decade. This growth is driven by the need for better inventory management, increased automation, and improved operational efficiency in logistics and supply chain operations.

The companies have been shortlisted based on hedge fund sentiment, sourced from our database of over 900 hedge funds. The best IoT stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a tech giant renowned for its innovative products. The iPhone, a well-known product by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), has been central to the company's IoT strategy. At the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shared exciting updates, including Apple Intelligence. This feature builds on years of AI and machine learning innovation and offers writing tools for self-expression, an image playground for creative image generation, and powerful tools for summarizing notifications. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a new record for June quarter revenue, reaching $85.8 billion, a 5% increase compared to the previous year. Furthermore, earnings per share grew by double digits to $1.40. The company also achieved quarterly revenue records in over two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, France, Mexico, Germany, India, the UK, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) set an all-time revenue record in services, which grew by 14%. Due to its financial strength, strong brand image, and product diversification, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has received an average rating of “Moderate Buy.” Here’s what Baron Funds said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Recent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.” Overall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the best IoT stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The attention now turns to other Magnificent Seven names, with EV maker Tesla (TSLA) set to report quarterly results on Wednesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led markets higher, up about 1% over the past week. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) followed, each securing weekly gains of around 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively.

Both the Dow Jones and S&P 500 reached all-time highs throughout the course of the week as well.

Meanwhile, the rotation out of megacap tech and into other areas of the market was on display last week as Utilities (XLU) ripped higher to end the five-day period up 3.4%, followed by Real Estate (XLRE) and Financials (XLF) with gains of 3% and 2.4%, respectively. Small caps also outpaced the major indexes, with the Russell 2000 (^RUT) finishing the week up around 2%.

The market moves come as investors have enjoyed a particularly strong start to earnings season, with Big Tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) still yet to report.

So far, 79% of S&P 500 companies have delivered a positive earnings surprise for Q3, which is above the overall five-year average of 77%, according to FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters.

The earnings season party will continue this week, with reports from Tesla, Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) among names set to highlight a busy calendar.

Outside of earnings, investors will also be monitoring a slew of economic data, including the final reading of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan due Friday. The Fed Beige Book, slated for Wednesday, will provide another pulse check on current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve districts.

The housing market will also be top of mind after mortgage rates increased for the third consecutive week, with the 30-year fixed rate inching closer to 6.5%.

A weekly update on jobless claims is also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.

Tesla is set to deliver quarterly earnings on Wednesday following the much-anticipated ""We, Robot"" event that took place on Oct. 10.

Wall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg expect the EV giant to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 on revenue of $25.42 billion.

2024-10-20T04:53:29+00:00,Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among the Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-among-most-045329078.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks owned by hedge funds.

Wall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a ‘substantial majority’ of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead.

The broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank’s next meeting in November.

However, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth.

She noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas.

Fundstrat Global Advisors’ co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month:

Earlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to ‘buy the dip’, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value.

Adam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast. With that said, let’s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q2 2024, it is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now, with 184 hedge funds having investments in the company. On August 1, Apple announced strong third-quarter results, generating a record revenue of $85.8 billion. This was a 5% growth from last year. Revenue from products grew 2% year-over-year to reach $61.6 billion, driven by the momentum gained from the launch of iPad Pro and iPad Air. Services revenue climbed 14% to a record-high $24.2 billion. Apple’s gross margin was reported at 46.3%. EPS for the quarter stood at $1.40, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.35 per share. A significant chunk of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s overall revenue during the quarter came from iPhone sales, which totaled $39.3 billion. However, the figure was down 1% year-over-year, due to a 6.5% drop in sales in Greater China, where Apple continues to face fierce competition from local manufacturers such as Huawei. This has led to some concern among investors around the stock. Another recent event that set the alarm bells ringing for some investors has been Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway slashing its stake in Apple by half. The company’s shares dropped 5% after the announcement on August 5, but have since then recovered. Financial experts believe that Buffett’s selling spree was triggered by speculation of an impending increase in the capital gains tax, and not due to Apple’s financial performance. Despite the cuts, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be the top stock in the billionaire’s portfolio, accounting for over 30% of the total holdings. You can read more on this in our recent article, Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Wall Street analysts have a consensus on the stock’s Buy rating, and the integration of artificial intelligence in the newly launched iPhone 16 has renewed investor confidence. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: Investors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon. iPad sales are also surging, having risen 24% during Q3 to reach $7.2 billion. Mac revenue grew 2% year-over-year to a total of $7 billion. The overall outlook for Apple looks encouraging as we enter the backend of 2024. Overall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

If you bought Apple (AAPL 0.36%) stock 10 years ago and held on, you'd be a pretty happy investor. Over the past decade, the stock has generated a nearly 800% return. As a result, a $50,000 investment would be worth about $450,000 today.

Apple is a tremendous story. The company was once on the brink of bankruptcy only to become one of the largest companies in the world. Now you may think given Apple's current size that the stock won't be able to turn in the same type of performance as it has the past decade. However, there are a few things to keep in mind.

One is that Apple's 10-year performance came when it was already the largest company in the world at the start of this period. Second, all of this outperformance occurred years after founder Steve Jobs had passed. With that in mind, let's look to see if an investment in Apple can set you up for life.

Reasons to be bullish on Apple

While Apple is best known for its popular iPhone, the real driving force behind its business in recent years has been its service business. Powered by its app store, Apple gets a piece of nearly every dollar spent through the platform. Currently, it gets up to 30% of every sale on its platform in most regions, or 15% from smaller developers.

While that may sound like a lot, it's similar to other distribution models. For example, Roku takes a 20% to 30% cut for streaming channels on its platform (excluding Netflix), while markups on certain goods from retailers can be quite high. However, the beauty of Apple's model is that its app store has very low overhead costs for app distribution.

As such, this leads to a very high-gross-margin business. Last quarter, its services business had 74% gross margins versus 35% gross margins for its product business. Its services segment includes other attractive high-margin businesses, such as Apple Pay, Apple Care, and cloud services, where users pay to get more storage on their devices. It is also home to Apple TV and Apple Music, which likely carry much lower margins due to content costs.

Apple has been able to become one of the world's most valuable companies by creating a walled-garden system over which it has a lot of control. This not only helps it create a smooth experience for users, but also a very sticky one. Once part of the Apple ecosystem, users tend to stay. As such, even as device sales have struggled recently, its high-margin service revenue has been still growing nicely, as evidenced by the 14% increase in revenue it saw last quarter.

Moving forward, Apple should have a nice opportunity with artificial intelligence (AI). This likely happens in two main ways. The first is that AI should spur a hardware upgrade cycle in the coming years as consumers upgrade their iPhones to newer models to run AI applications. Second, as users buy more AI-related apps from the app store, Apple should see a nice boost to revenue and profits.

An investment in Apple is not without its risks.

The company has the potential to lose out on a big chunk of high-margin revenue it was getting from Alphabet to use Google as its default search engine on its devices. Alphabet recently lost an antitrust lawsuit, and one of the government's big contentions was the agreement between the two companies.

The Google deal has been estimated to be as high as $25 billion a year from analysts at Jefferies, as Alphabet was paying Apple 36% of its search revenue that originated from Safari to be the exclusive search engine for the web browser. While that is only about 6% of Apple's revenue, it is pure margin, so it has been projected to be nearly 20% of its operating profits.

The final remedy of the Alphabet antitrust case is still unknown, but the exclusive search deal between Apple and Alphabet will likely be impacted. I wouldn't expect all of this revenue to go away. There could still be a non-exclusive revenue share deal between the two, and it is likely that most users will stick with Google Search as their default, given the alternative options. In this scenario, maybe Alphabet pays a smaller percentage, or maybe it doesn't. Meanwhile, any other search providers would also likely have to pay a percentage of their search revenue as well.

Apple could also opt to use an internally developed search engine and keep all the ad revenue generated from searches on its devices. While the company prefers to use Google, the internally developed option can be used if it is not getting paid enough money due to losing its exclusive deal. Apple has been rumored to have been working on a search engine for a couple of years. If true, it could, at the very least, use this as leverage when negotiating non-exclusive deals.

Apple also faces a regulatory risk to its App Store business as well, as companies have complained about the cut the company takes. However, the tech giant has won lawsuits in the U.S. in the past and has come up with creative ways to keep app developers from using third-party app stores in Europe, after the European Union forced it to open up its business. This included charging third-party app stores a core technology fee of 50 euro cents ($0.54) per user per year. In addition, app developers that have more than 1 million installs per year would have to pay the same fee for every new install over 1 million. That can add up to a lot of money fast.

While Apple is facing some risks, the company has shown to be resourceful in the past and should be able to mitigate anything that comes it way. The stock has been a long-term winner for a reason, and I don't see that changing. Meanwhile, AI could be the next catalyst to drive the stock higher.

While Apple's stock by itself may not set you up for life moving forward, it can still be a solid core position in your portfolio.",AAPL,yes,eod,1221

2024-10-19T07:24:00+00:00,Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Oct. 31?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-apple-stock-oct-31-072400148.html,"It hasn't been an easy year for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker faced several headwinds, including an antitrust lawsuit and slower sales of its most important device in China. Still, Apple's stock performance in 2024 hasn't been terrible, not by a long shot. The company's shares are up 20% year to date, barely trailing the S&P 500. How will Apple perform through the end of the year and beyond? The company's next quarterly update on Oct. 31 might move the needle one way or another.

Let's find out whether it's worth purchasing Apple's shares before that date.

Will Apple Intelligence have an effect?

One reason Apple did not perform well in the first part of the year is that investors and analysts saw that it was trailing its similarly sized fellow tech leaders in the important artificial intelligence (AI) industry. However, the company has never sought to be first to market. Apple has usually found ways to put its own ingenious spin on existing products and services to attract customers. In June, the company finally announced how it would integrate AI into its business.

Apple announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related services that will be available on some of its devices. These features will only be for users of selected devices, including the iPhone 15 Pro, the latest iteration of the company's smartphone, the iPhone 16, and various newer versions of some of its other famous brands. Most of these features aren't out yet. They will be released (in a somewhat limited capacity) later this month. But during Apple's next earnings update -- for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2024 -- it will be interesting to see how much sales of the iPhone grew compared to the previous few periods.

In the nine months ending June 29, iPhone sales declined by 1.2% year over year to $155 billion. If they move in the right direction by a substantial margin, that might be a clue that people are buying what Apple is selling -- at least, that they're purchasing those versions of the iPhone where Apple Intelligence will be available. The company could experience a robust cycle of renewals as a result, boosting iPhone sales and overall top-line growth.

It could also attract new customers into Apple's ecosystem. The company has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices -- it hit new all-time highs across the range of its gadgets and in most geographical regions during its latest period. The growth of Apple's installed base is essential for its future, since it helps fuel revenue growth within its high-margin services segment. The more people are plugged into its ecosystem, the more money it can squeeze out of it.

Apple could also benefit from its upcoming quarterly update if it simply beats on revenue and earnings. If it can do that while showing that it's starting an exciting cycle of renewals thanks to Apple Intelligence and growing its installed base simultaneously, its shares will almost certainly jump. Here's an even better question It's hard to predict what will happen. Those who buy Apple's shares now expecting them to rise on the heels of its quarterly update might or might not be disappointed. So, for those considering investing today, the better question is whether Apple can still deliver solid returns over the long run, regardless of what happens on Oct. 31. In my view, the tech giant still can. Apple's most important assets are its innovative abilities and large and growing user ecosystem. The first will allow it to identify and successfully pursue new growth opportunities, while the latter grants it umpteen monetization opportunities while helping to improve its margins and bottom line over the long run. There are many other reasons why the business still has attractive long-term opportunities. Apple's brand name -- one of the world's strongest -- grants it a powerful competitive edge, and the company is a decent income pick. True, its forward dividend yield of 0.44% isn't impressive -- the average for the S&P 500 is 1.32%. However, the tech giant has increased its dividends by almost 113% in the past 10 years and boasts a low (perhaps too low) cash payout ratio of 14.56%. There is ample room for more dividend hikes. Between Apple's dividend and growth opportunities, there are enough reasons for long-term investors to purchase the company's shares right now.

2024-10-18T22:22:19+00:00,Apple’s Top Recruiter Heads to Citadel in Latest HR Upheaval,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-top-recruiter-heads-citadel-222219660.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s top recruiting executive is leaving to become the chief people officer at investment firm Citadel, according to people with knowledge of the matter, marking another major departure for the iPhone maker’s tumultuous human resources team.

Sjoerd Gehring, a vice president who oversaw Apple talent management, immigration, recruiting and administration of its global HR team, is joining the Miami-based hedge fund next month, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the news hasn’t been shared publicly. Spokespeople for Citadel and Apple declined to comment.

Earlier this week, Apple told employees that Gehring’s boss — Chief People Officer Carol Surface — is departing after just about 18 months in the job. Surface had announced Gehring’s exit internally last Thursday. At Citadel, Gehring will replace Matt Jahansouz, who left the firm last month.

Gehring told colleagues he was drawn to the Citadel job because he will be closer to family on the East Coast and because of a long-held desire to be a chief people officer. But people with knowledge of the matter also say that Surface’s management style — and a desire to no longer work for her — contributed to Gehring wanting to leave Apple.

Surface is being replaced by Deirdre O’Brien, the company’s retail chief. O’Brien had overseen the HR duties until Surface was hired early last year and will retake that role. She is one of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s most trusted lieutenants, and employees believe that she will help bring stability back to the group, the people said.

Over the past several months, Apple has seen a rash of departures from its human resources organization, including multiple employees exiting its diversity and inclusion, executive recruiting and college recruiting groups. Employees say that, under Surface’s leadership, the larger team has been mired in dysfunction and that her management style sometimes came across to staffers as off-putting.

Apple’s head of diversity and inclusion, Barbara Whye, is leaving the iPhone maker and will be replaced by former Bank of America Corp. executive Cynthia Bowman. Whye and Surface had an adversarial relationship, some of the people said. Apple declined to comment on behalf of the two executives. Surface didn’t respond to a separate request for comment.

In March, head of compensation Heidi Holter, who also reported to Surface, departed for ServiceNow Inc. And Eddie McLeod, a top deputy to Gehring, left for a senior HR role at Ford Motor Co. last year. The division had a revolving door even prior to Surface joining. In 2022, HR Vice President Jennifer Waldo departed to become head of people at Ford. Before that, Apple University boss Joel Podolny, who oversaw an internal school for employees, left for a startup. In 2017, Denise Young Smith, Apple’s first head of diversity, exited after one year in the role. Her replacement, Christie Smith, left after only three years at the company. The same year as Young Smith’s exit, the former head of talent for Apple’s retail department, Stephanie Fehr, left to become chief people officer at UnitedHealthcare. Citadel Chief Operating Officer Gerald Beeson informed employees about Gehring joining the company, saying that “Sjoerd will spearhead our efforts to attract top candidates from around the world and help them build extraordinary careers at Citadel matching their merit and ambition.” Beeson added that the company is “committed to hiring and developing exceptional talent,” according to the letter, which was seen by Bloomberg. For Citadel, the Gehring hire is a coup. He was highly respected at Apple in his roughly six years at the company. Employees within Apple’s HR division say they are disappointed he won’t be Apple’s next chief people officer and that he is highly qualified for the role. Prior to his work at the iPhone maker, he “led recruiting and employee experience for Johnson & Johnson and, earlier in his career, served for a decade at Accenture, where he led its Talent Innovation Lab,” Beeson said in the Citadel memo. Citadel is known as the most profitable hedge fund and is run by billionaire Ken Griffin. While the firm is now based in Florida, Gehring will work out of the company’s New York offices.

In a new interview, Trump revealed the two spoke on the phone earlier this week and said he credits Cook with the tech giant’s success.

“I believe that if Tim Cook didn’t run Apple, if Steve Jobs did, it wouldn’t be nearly as successful as it is now,” Trump said, referencing the Apple founder and former CEO who died in 2011 from cancer. “I think Tim Cook’s done an amazing job. And I’m not knocking Steve Jobs.”

Trump made the comments during a podcast interview with Patrick Bet-David released on Thursday. Bet-David asked Trump about his relationship with Cook, after Trump revealed the two had spoken just “two hours” prior to recording.

“Then two hours ago, three hours ago, he called me,” Trump said during his interview. “He said, ‘I’d like to talk to you about something.’ ‘What?’ He said, ‘The European Union has just fined us $15 billion.’ That’s a lot.”

In September a top EU court found that Apple owed Ireland back taxes worth €13 billion, or roughly $14.4 billion. Earlier this year, in March, the EU hit Apple with a $2 billion antitrust fine for allegedly throttling rivals to its streaming service Apple Music in its iOS App Store.

Trump marveled at the size of the fines the EU levied against Apple, saying they were “a lot.”

“I even said about Apple, can you pay that? I mean, do you have that kind—that’s a lot of money,” Trump said.

Trump then drew parallels with his own legal troubles in the U.S., where he was convicted of 34 felony counts in one criminal case, while still awaiting trial in three others.

“I know the feeling because I get fined, too, and fake cases. But I don’t know if his case is fake yet, but it’s a lot,” Trump said.

Trump went on to detail his relationship with Cook, which he said had been productive. In 2019, when Trump was in the White House, he had implemented a series of tariffs on certain imports from China. Among the products subject to those tariffs were certain parts needed to make Apple products, which Cook had sought a waiver to avoid. Cook then met with Trump to press his case in person. The former president granted Cook the waiver upon the condition that Apple would invest in U.S. manufacturing for its Mac Pro. In reality, Apple already made the computers in Texas.

Cook would later gift Trump a Mac Pro made at the Texas manufacturing facility.

Regarding the discussions with Cook, Trump said he appreciated the Apple CEO’s personal involvement in the matter.

“Most companies send in lobbyists that get paid millions and millions of dollars to talk for them,” Trump said. “And they probably say, ‘We know Trump. We can talk.’ But they don’t. For the most part, they don’t. Tim Cook called me up directly, and he did it himself. [He] didn’t have to pay 10 cents. I gave him 100% of what he wanted because he was right.”

Cook’s argument regarding the 2019 tariffs, according to Trump, was that they would make it too difficult for Apple to compete with Samsung because it didn’t have to import components from China. Over the years Trump has always spoken fondly of Cook. “Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly,” Trump said in August 2019. “That’s why he’s a great executive, because he calls me, and others don’t.” During the interview with Bet-David, Trump recounted how excited he was to receive a call from Cook back in 2019. “He calls. ‘Could I see you, sir?’ He’s the head of Apple. And I was born in Queens, and I said, ‘Oh, the head of Apple wants to see me. Let’s go.’ Even though I’m president I was born in Queens and the head of Apple’s calling.” Trump’s fondness for tariffs have featured heavily on the campaign trail during his third bid for the White House. They are now part of a major policy proposal in which Trump aims to level blanket tariffs of 20% on all imported products and 60% to 100% tariffs on goods from China. Economists say the policy would be broadly inflationary and that it would raise costs for consumers. When reached for comment about whether a future Trump administration would intervene with the EU on behalf of Apple, Trump campaign senior advisor Brian Hughes cited support from “industry leaders like Elon Musk and David Sacks” as evidence of the strength of his economic policies. “President Trump’s agenda includes economic, energy, and regulatory policies that will allow the U.S. to reclaim its global dominance of innovation and technology,” Hughes said in a statement. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",AAPL,yes,eod,1001
2024-10-18T19:20:35+00:00,Judge delays order in antitrust case requiring Google to open up its app store,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/judge-delays-order-antitrust-case-192035065.html,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge on Friday delayed an order requiring Google to open up its Android app store to more competition until an appeals court decides whether to block the shake-up because of legal questions surrounding a jury's verdict that branded Google as an illegal monopolist.

The delay granted during a court hearing in San Francisco comes less than two weeks after U.S. District Judge James Donato issued a decision that would have forced Google to make sweeping changes to its Play Store for Android smartphones starting Nov. 1.

The mandated changes included a provision that would have required Google to make its library of more than 2 million Android apps available to any rivals that wanted access to the inventory and also distribute the alternative options in its own Play Store.

Google requested Donato's order be stayed until the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals could examine the handling of a monthlong trial that led to the December 2023 verdict, which framed the Play Store as an illegal monopoly that stifles innovation and drives up consumer prices.

In Friday's hearing, Donato scoffed at the notion that Google could succeed in overturning the trial verdict. “The verdict in this case was amply supported by a mountain of evidence about Google’s anti-competitive conduct,” the judge said.

But he decided the Ninth Circuit should be given a chance to consider a postponement until a panel of judges can decide can consider Google's appeal of the 2023 trial focused on antitrust claims lodged by video game maker Epic Games.

Donato said he wouldn't be surprised if the Ninth Circuit imposes an even longer delay on his ruling, “but that is for someone else to decide.”

In a statement, Google said it was pleased Donato hit the pause button while it tries to extend the delay even further.

“These remedies threaten Google Play’s ability to provide a safe and secure experience and we look forward to continuing to make our case to protect 100 million U.S. Android users, over 500,000 U.S. developers and thousands of partners who have benefited from our platforms,” Google said.

Epic pointed to Donato's critical comments about the merits of Google's appeal in a statement that described the stay as a “procedural step.”

It's unclear how long the Ninth Circuit will take to decide on Google's request for a permanent stay of Donato's ruling while its appeals unfolds — a process that could take more than a year.

In 2021, the Ninth Circuit delayed a provision of another federal judge's order mandating that Apple allow links to alternative payment systems with apps made for the iPhone as part of another antitrust case brought by Epic.

Although Apple avoided being labeled an illegal monopolist in a trial involving the iPhone app store, it unsuccessfully fought the provision requiring the company to allow alternative payment links within apps. But delaying that requirement preserved Apple's exclusive control of a payment system that has generated commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on some e-commerce occurring within apps. Apple exhausted its avenue of appeals in the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year. Google also pockets billions of dollars annually from a similar commission system within its Play Store for Android phones — a setup that is allowed to continue as long as Google can prevent Donato's ruling from taking effect.

Currently, Nordstrom's stock is priced at $24.7075, which is considered modestly overvalued based on the GF Value of $20.00. The stock has shown a significant year-to-date increase of 35.09% and an impressive gain of 9.86% since the transaction date. Despite these gains, Nordstrom's financial health shows mixed signals with a Financial Strength rank of 5/10 and a Profitability Rank of 6/10. The company's growth metrics are concerning, with a Growth Rank of 0/10, indicating potential challenges in sustaining its financial performance.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio

The recent reduction in Nordstrom shares by State Street Corp has minimally impacted its vast portfolio, given the small percentage position of the stock. This strategic divestment could be indicative of the firm's portfolio rebalancing or a shift in investment focus away from retail-cyclical stocks, which may not align with their current investment objectives or market outlook.

Nordstrom operates within the competitive retail-cyclical sector. Compared to its peers, Nordstrom has maintained a robust return on equity (ROE) of 35.19%, significantly higher than many competitors. However, its growth and profitability metrics lag behind industry leaders, necessitating strategic initiatives to enhance these areas. State Street Corp's recent reduction in its stake in Nordstrom Inc reflects a strategic adjustment within its extensive portfolio. While Nordstrom continues to perform well in terms of stock price appreciation and ROE, its growth challenges highlight the need for operational enhancements. Investors and market watchers will likely keep a close eye on Nordstrom's strategies to improve its market position and financial health in the competitive retail sector.

The firm reduced its holdings by 2,315 shares, which adjusted its total share count to 415,573. Despite this reduction, the transaction had a minimal direct impact on the firm's portfolio, maintaining a 4.40% holding ratio in Nabors Industries Ltd. The shares were traded at a price of $64.47.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a major institutional investor known for its strategic investment decisions. The firm manages a diverse portfolio with a significant emphasis on technology and financial services sectors. Its top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), showcasing a strong inclination towards high-performing tech stocks. The firm's investment philosophy focuses on leveraging market trends and technological advancements to maximize returns.

Nabors Industries Ltd, based in Bermuda, operates one of the largest land-based drilling rig fleets globally. Since its IPO on February 28, 1991, the company has expanded its services to include performance tools, directional drilling, and innovative technologies, with operations spanning over 15 countries. The company's business is segmented into U.S. Drilling, Canada Drilling, International Drilling, Drilling Solutions, and Rig Technologies, with a significant revenue contribution from its international drilling operations.

Financial and Market Analysis of Nabors Industries Ltd

Currently, Nabors Industries Ltd holds a market capitalization of approximately $676.71 million, with a recent stock price of $70.87. The stock is considered a possible value trap according to the GF Value, which suggests a cautious approach due to its current price to GF Value ratio of 0.59. Despite a year-to-date price decrease of 12.35%, the stock has shown a gain of 9.93% since the recent transaction by State Street Corp. The company's financial strength and profitability are areas of concern, with a GF Score of 62/100, indicating poor future performance potential.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corps Portfolio

The recent reduction in Nabors Industries Ltd shares by State Street Corp reflects a strategic portfolio adjustment rather than a significant shift. This move aligns with the firm's broader investment strategy, which heavily favors technology and financial sectors, suggesting a reallocation of resources to potentially higher yield areas.

State Street Corp's investment focus remains robust in technology and financial services, sectors that are pivotal to its overall strategy. This strategic focus is evident from its top holdings and the substantial equity managed within these sectors, amounting to $2,285.63 trillion. Other notable investors in Nabors Industries Ltd include Gotham Asset Management, LLC, which holds a significant share percentage, making it one of the largest shareholders. Comparatively, State Street Corp's holdings represent a strategic but not dominant investment within its diversified portfolio. Given the challenging financial metrics and market performance of Nabors Industries Ltd, State Street Corp's decision to reduce its stake might be a prudent move. The future performance of Nabors will likely hinge on improvements in its operational and financial efficiencies, areas currently reflected as underwhelming in its GF Scores and financial rankings. As the market dynamics evolve, State Street Corp's adept adjustments in its investment portfolio will be crucial in maintaining its strong market position, especially in its favored sectors.

The recent acquisition increases State Street Corp's total shares in Moog Inc to 1,385,807, representing a 4.80% stake in the company. This addition has a modest impact on the firm's portfolio, with Moog Inc now constituting 0.01% of its total investments.

2024-10-18T14:15:00+00:00,Apple Shares Hit All-Time High: Time to Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-shares-hit-time-high-141500105.html,"Long-time cash-generating king Apple AAPL has been a staple in portfolios over the years, providing investors with outsized gains. And recently, the Mag 7 member hit fresh all-time highs, reflecting considerably bullish price action.

Stocks making new highs tend to make even higher highs, particularly when a company’s outlook remains positive.

Should investors tap into the momentum? Let’s take a closer look at how the tech titan stacks up.

Firstly, investors should be aware the company is expected to report its next set of quarterly results on October 31st after the market’s close.

Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.

Expectations for the above-mentioned release are overall flat from the end of July, but the recent downward revisions that hit the tape near the beginning of October are certainly more notable given their recency.

Modest growth is forecasted, with the current $1.54 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting a 5% climb year-over-year. Top line revisions have been slightly more positive, with forecasted sales of $94.5 billion 5.6% higher than the year-ago figure.

A key item to keep an eye on during the upcoming release is the company’s Services results, which have provided a nice growth tailwind over recent years and have consistently exceeded consensus expectations in recent periods.

For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services revenue stands at $25.8 billion, 15% higher than the year-ago mark and reflecting an all-time record. Investors should also expect commentary surrounding the iPhone 16 and its AI efforts as well.

The valuation picture here is a bit rich, likely reflective of investors’ consistent growth expectations. The current forward 12-month earnings multiple works out to 30.5X, well above the 26.3X five-year median but beneath five-year highs of 36.1X.

2024-10-18T07:39:15+00:00,"Apple's new iPhone sales in China jump 20% in first 3 weeks,  Counterpoint says",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-iphone-sales-china-jump-073915641.html,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple Inc's new iPhones got off to a strong start in China, with their sales rising 20% in their first three weeks since their launch compared with its 2023 model, according to data from research firm Counterpoint.

Both Apple and Huawei's latest smartphones went on sale in China on Sept. 20, underscoring intensifying competition in the world's biggest smartphone market where the U.S. firm has been losing market share in recent quarters to domestic rivals.

""We're seeing strong iPhone 16 series unit sales in China,"" Counterpoint said, adding the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models were doing particularly well, with their combined sales rising 44% compared with their equivalent 2023 versions.

Overall iPhone unit sales in China, however, dropped 2% year on year during the three-week period because of decreased sales of older models and increased competition with Huawei's Mate and Pura series, it said.",AAPL,yes,eod,194
2024-10-18T05:58:18+00:00,Apple iPhone 16 Sales Soar 20% in China Debut as Demand Recovers,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-iphone-16-sales-soar-055818158.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Sales of Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones in China are up 20% in their first three weeks compared with 2023’s model, a positive sign for a device that struggled this year to gain traction in the world’s largest smartphone market.

The iPhone 16 debuted in September and has outperformed its predecessor so far, according to Counterpoint Research data provided to Bloomberg News. Consumers continue to shift to the pricier models, and sales of the top-end Pro and Pro Max models gained 44% compared with last year’s equivalents.

While just a three-week snapshot, the data suggests Apple’s 2024 launch is faring better than last year’s. Production issues hampered the iPhone 15 family early on, which may have constrained initial sales, Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam said. Apple’s marquee device also faced a stiff challenge from Huawei Technologies Co.’s Mate 60 series, which won over local consumers with a made-in-China processor. That device continues to sell well, according to Lam.

“Given the smooth production ramp-up, consistent pricing strategy, and the initial wave of upgrades by existing iPhone users, the iPhone 16 series has experienced substantial growth in the Chinese domestic market,” Lam said. “The product mix has also improved markedly.”

Apple shares rose to a record this week, fueled by optimism around the rollout of the artificial-intelligence-powered iPhones. The stock gained as much as 1.7% after trading opened in New York on Friday.

Analysts had warned that the iPhone 16 might fare poorly in China, given the absence of a local partner to power AI features. Beijing has barred foreign-developed AI models, meaning Apple may have to secure a local partner such as Baidu Inc.

The jump in iPhone 16 sales in China “was unexpected given muted spending on luxury goods,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard, who added that while early adopters may have fueled this recent sales pop, they are “less optimistic about double-digit growth for 2025.”

Analysts from Wedbush said they believe this iPhone upgrade cycle could be a “historic” one. “China sales for iPhone 16 will show a strong rebound over the next year with the beginning of this AI-driven supercycle,” they wrote in a note.

Though off to a good start, the iPhone 16 faces a number of big local rivals this year. Vivo just announced its new X200 Pro flagship, Huawei is expected to introduce its next-generation Mate device in November and Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo are set to update their lineups before year’s end. China remains the world’s largest — and by Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s estimation, most competitive — smartphone market in the world. For Apple, the iPhone remains by far its most important product, as it directly contributes roughly half of all sales and draws consumers in to buy accessories like the Apple Watch or subscription services like Apple Music. But the smartphone market has been stagnant for years, and it remains to be seen how well the latest generation will fare over the full course of its time on sale. The iPhone 16 is debuting after a rocky 2023, when the world’s No. 2 economy struggled to escape a post-Covid funk. That downturn worsened in 2024 alongside a property crisis. Some Chinese consumers may now hold off on large purchases until November’s Singles’ Day discounts from retailers like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. kick in, Lam said.

2024-10-17T22:35:01+00:00,Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-most-promising-223501032.html,"We recently compiled a list of 10 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.

Another 50 bps Cut is Still Restrictive

The labor market has been more resilient than ever. On October 4, Gary Cohn, the IBM vice chairman, and former US National Economic Council director in the Trump administration, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the job report and the US economy.

Cohn suggests that the jobs data is the least scientific information the government puts out and therefore, it must be taken with a grain of salt. However, he emphasizes the importance of understanding trends. The number of people entering the workforce is expanding and jobs are being created, deducing that the market is in a neutral place.

Cohn believes that the US economy is normalizing. He reveals that we have not lived in a normal economy in over a decade, therefore, relative to history, the status quo is fairly reasonable. He adds that the Fed has orchestrated a soft landing and expects another 50 basis point cut before the end of 2024, which according to him is still restrictive.

As the AI flame starts to settle, the market may be up for a major shift. On October 7, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his expectations of the market.

Expectations for earnings have been revised from mid-single digits to mid-double digitals, promising robust growth as 2024 comes to a close. Buchanan suggests that most of the growth comes from artificial intelligence and the widening of earnings growth beyond traditional growth sectors like technology.

This year, the industrial and energy sectors have enjoyed greater returns capturing a large chunk of the market. Buchanan is highly bullish on AI plays and value stocks. He also adds that names in financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary are poised for growth ahead of 2024. He advises investors to consider geopolitical events before making any investment decisions.

Now that we have assessed the future of the financial markets and possible sectors eyeing growth, let’s take a look at the 10 most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.

To find the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds, we went over multiple rankings over the internet to list long-term blue chip stocks. We then examined the analyst upside and the hedge fund sentiment of these stocks as of Q2 2024 and picked the most popular ones. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024 as a primary metric and analyst upside as of October 13, as a secondary metric.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the popular company behind the iPhone, ranks third on our list of the most promising stocks according to hedge funds. The company offers a range of products including iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+. The company is leveraging artificial intelligence to offer unmatched experiences to its customers. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence by Apple backed by AI. The system is integrated into the new iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Speaking of its biggest avenue for revenue, the iPhone generated revenue worth $39.3 billion during FQ3 2024, making up for nearly 45% of the total revenue. Over the past 10 years, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has grown its revenue and net income by 8% and 10% respectively. Last month, the company launched its new iPhone 16, iOS 18 system, AirPods 4, and Apple Watch Series 10 around the world. While Apple has its bets on the new iPhone, one can say that its integrated artificial intelligence systems will play a role in boosting financial performance for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Columbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company’s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple’s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn’t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.” Overall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Apple did not respond to a request seeking confirmation of the authenticity of the phone call.

European regulators have launched a series of investigations into Big Tech firms in recent years, with the aim of curbing their power and ensuring a level playing field for smaller rivals.

""Two hours ago, three hours ago, he (Cook) called me,"" Trump said, while speaking with podcaster Patrick Bet-David in a program that was released on Thursday. ""He said the European Union has just fined us $15 billion. ... Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion,"" Trump added, quoting his call with Cook.

Last month, Apple lost a long-running court battle with the European Union, resulting in Apple's being forced to pay 13 billion euros ($14.08 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, as part of a wider crackdown. Earlier this year, the company was hit with a $2 billion EU antitrust fine for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.

""Tim, I got to get elected first. ... But I'm not going to let them take advantage of our companies. That won't be happening,"" Trump quoted himself as saying to Cook, during the nearly 90-minute podcast appearance.

However, the industry faces dynamic challenges that could impact Hasbro's performance. Investors and market watchers will be keen on how Hasbro navigates these challenges and leverages its brand strength for future growth.

2024-10-17T19:27:04+00:00,Apple Introduces Business Caller ID to Enhance User Privacy and Block Spam,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-introduces-business-caller-id-192704870.html,"Apple (AAPL, Financial) is on course to roll out a new service, which may well be called Business Caller ID, sometime early next year. The service will allow users to recognize business callers easily. This will be a component of Apple Business Connect that will let companies sign up their name, logo, and department so that when callers identify them, there will be increased credibility.

According to David Dorn, Apple's senior director of Internet Software and Services Product, it was developed to provide relevant information to businesses that will enable them to put forward the correct information to Apple users to help them engage the service and grow their business. Registered companies will have more control over how their business information is displayed across Apple services such as Maps, Messages, Siri, and Wallet to have a perfect fit in the Apple services continuum.

The service will be available to all companies without any discrimination based on their size. Companies will be able to register using a current Apple ID or obtain a new one at no cost. Given that it will be launched across over one billion Apple devices, its global base is visible, meaning that the target audience is equally diverse.

Business Caller ID will work for calls and messages, Promotional emails, and even be connected to Apple Pay as the Visual Identity in supported markets. This unified approach should also improve the quality of the user experience, as Apple product users are likely to see a coherent business image in their various modes of communication at the beginning of the new year 2025 and beyond. It should also provide adequate safeguards against most spam and fraudulent messages.

“I believe that if Tim Cook didn’t run Apple if Steve Jobs did, it wouldn’t be nearly as successful as it is now,” Trump said on an episode of the PBD Podcast filmed on Wednesday and released on Thursday. “I think so because I think Tim Cook has done an amazing job, and I’m not knocking Steve Jobs, but it wouldn’t have been the same.”

The kind words from the Republican presidential nominee are emblematic of the close relationship Cook fostered with Trump while he was in office. Cook frequently called Trump when he was president, sat on the administration’s Workforce Policy Advisory Board, and hosted Trump at Apple’s Austin, Texas, campus.

In 2019, after Cook managed to convince Trump to get Apple an exemption from a series of tariffs affecting Chinese imports, Cook gifted the then-president with one of the first Mac Pros built at its new U.S. facility. In an interview with Bloomberg News in June, Trump remarked that he found Cook to be “a very good businessman.”

“Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly,” Trump told reporters in August 2019. “That’s why he’s a great executive because he calls me, and others don’t.”

During the podcast, Trump also said Cook had called to discuss the billions of dollars the European Union has fined Apple, adding that he won’t let the bloc “take advantage” of American companies if he wins the November election.

“Two hours ago, three hours ago, he called me,” Trump said, before discussing the bloc’s recent actions.

An E.U. judge in September ruled that Apple must pay back almost $15 billion in unpaid taxes. In March, the bloc’s regulatory arm fined Apple almost $2 billion for abusing its dominant position its the distribution of music streaming apps like Spotify (SPOT) or its own Apple Music.

“He said they’re using that to run their enterprise, meaning Europe is their enterprise. “I said, ‘That’s a lot... But Tim, I got to get elected first, but I’m not going to let them take advantage of our companies — that won’t, you know, be happening.’”

• One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided
• Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes
• Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says

Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrested Eric Council Jr. on Thursday morning and charged the 25-year-old with conspiring to commit aggravated identity theft, according to a statement from the Justice Department.

Council allegedly used the stolen personal information of an unnamed victim as well as an iPhone to break through the X account’s security measures, according to the indictment. The alleged scheme at one point involved Council impersonating an FBI employee who lost his phone, the government says.

The SEC’s account on X, formerly Twitter, was hacked in early January, just a day before it was set to announce approval of the first-ever spot market Bitcoin exchange traded products. The hacker took control of the agency’s official account and posted a message that said the SEC had granted approval to a handful of companies’ applications to trade the products.

The approval of the ETFs, which followed a long legal fight between the SEC and the issuer of one of the funds, was one of the most eagerly anticipated events ever in the digital-asset industry. The green light from the regulator helped push the original cryptocurrency to a record high of $73,797 in March. The funds have seen more than $20 billion of inflows and collectively now hold about $64.5 billion worth of assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The fake post with the premature approval caused the price of Bitcoin to surge $1,000, the Justice Department said. Once the SEC regained control of its X account and revealed the post was fake, Bitcoin fell by $2,000, according to the statement.

“The SEC thanks law enforcement for their vigilance in seeking accountability for those responsible for the breach of the SEC’s X account,” a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement.

Prosecutors say Council gained access to the SEC account using a so-called SIM swap, which is when hackers fraudulently activate a victim’s phone number on a different device in order to intercept their phone calls and messages. This allows hackers to receive multi-factor authentication codes when trying to reset a victim’s email, social media or cryptocurrency exchange account.

The SEC hack allegedly began on Jan. 9, when co-conspirators using encrypted text messages sent Council the victim’s personal identifying information, as well as a template for the victim’s identification card. Council allegedly used an identity card printer to create a fake ID for the victim, according to the indictment. With the fake ID in hand, Council allegedly traveled to an AT&T store in Huntsville, Alabama, to get a SIM card linked to the victim’s account. Council then walked to an Apple store to buy a new iPhone for the swap, according to the indictment. As soon as access to the victim’s phone was granted, the co-conspirators generated access codes to the victim’s social media accounts and shared them with additional co-conspirators, according to the indictment. The fake post was issued by one of the unnamed co-conspirators, according to the indictment. Once that was done, Council allegedly drove to a service provider’s store in Birmingham, Alabama, to return the iPhone for cash. Council, whose online pseudonyms include @Easymunny, is scheduled to appear at a detention hearing on Oct. 22 in federal court in Huntsville, Alabama. He’s being represented in the matter by a federal public defender, Kevin Butler, who didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment. The case is US v. Council, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). --With assistance from Lydia Beyoud, Margi Murphy and Nicola M. White.

This move reduced their holding to 794,645 shares, reflecting a strategic adjustment in their investment portfolio. The shares were traded at a price of $12.02 each, marking a pivotal shift in State Street Corp's investment strategy.

Compass Minerals International Inc, trading under the symbol CMP, is primarily involved in the production of salt and specialty potash fertilizers. With key assets across North America and the United Kingdom, the company serves a diverse range of sectors from deicing to agriculture. The firm's strategic operations in potash and salt extraction have positioned it as a key player in the industry.

Financial and Market Analysis of Compass Minerals International Inc

As of the latest data, Compass Minerals holds a market capitalization of $565.031 million with a current stock price of $13.67. Despite a challenging market environment indicated by a year-to-date price decline of 45.12%, the stock has seen a recent upturn with a 13.73% gain since the transaction date. The company's valuation metrics suggest caution, with a GF Value of $30.47 and a price to GF Value ratio of 0.45, signaling a potential value trap scenario.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio

The recent transaction has notably decreased Compass Minerals' position in State Street Corp's extensive portfolio, now constituting only 1.90% of their holdings. This reduction aligns with the firm's strategic realignment, possibly due to the stock's underwhelming financial performance and market valuation concerns.

State Street Corp primarily invests in technology and financial services, sectors that generally promise high growth and stability. The decision to reduce exposure to the metals and mining sector, represented by Compass Minerals, may reflect a strategic shift towards more lucrative and stable investments, considering the volatile nature of commodity-based industries.

Compass Minerals, with a GF Score of 55, indicates a potential for poor future performance. Analysts are cautious, given the company's financial struggles, including a significant debt load and negative profitability metrics. The future performance of CMP will likely hinge on its ability to improve operational efficiency and market conditions in the metals and mining sector.

The firm sold 1,109,678 shares at a price of $4.72 each, resulting in a remaining stake of 896,123 shares. This move reflects a strategic adjustment in State Street Corp's investment portfolio, despite the trade having a minimal immediate impact on its overall position.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent investment firm known for its robust investment strategies that focus primarily on long-term value creation. With a diverse portfolio of 4,172 stocks, the firm's top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), emphasizing a strong inclination towards the technology and financial services sectors. The firm manages an equity portfolio worth approximately $2,285.63 trillion, showcasing its significant influence in the market.

Cabaletta Bio Inc specializes in engineered T cell therapies aimed at treating B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Utilizing its proprietary Chimeric AutoAntibody Receptor (CAART) technology, the company focuses on selective B cell elimination, which could potentially offer curative treatments. Despite its innovative approach, Cabaletta Bio has faced challenges reflected in its financial metrics, with a market cap of $230.563 million and a GF Score of 39/100, indicating poor future performance potential.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio

The recent reduction in CABA shares by State Street Corp has adjusted the firm's exposure to the biotechnology sector, which now stands at a 1.80% position ratio in their portfolio. This move might be indicative of the firm's strategy to reallocate resources to more promising areas or to mitigate risks associated with the volatile biotech sector.

Since its IPO on October 25, 2019, CABA's stock has declined by 47.56%, with a significant year-to-date drop of 78.7%. These figures highlight the stock's underperformance and the challenging market conditions it faces. The stock's current price aligns with its trade price, suggesting a stable short-term market perception but an uncertain future.

The decision by State Street Corp to reduce its stake in Cabaletta Bio could be driven by the stock's consistent underperformance and the firm's risk management strategy. Looking ahead, the biotechnology sector remains innovative but highly speculative. Cabaletta Bio's future depends on its clinical outcomes and ability to secure regulatory approvals, which are pivotal for its CAART technology's success.

When compared to State Street Corp's other top holdings like Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, Cabaletta Bio represents a smaller, more speculative investment. This sectoral diversification is crucial for balancing potential high-reward investments against stable, high-value assets. State Street Corp's recent portfolio adjustment by reducing its stake in Cabaletta Bio Inc reflects a strategic move to optimize its investment spread. For investors, this transaction highlights the importance of risk assessment and potential realignment in response to market and company-specific challenges. As the market watches Cabaletta Bio's progress, the implications of such investment shifts are critical for understanding broader market dynamics and investment strategies.

This transaction, executed at a price of $24.5 per share, reflects State Street Corp's strategic approach to investing in high-potential sectors. The acquisition not only underscores the firm's commitment to the biotechnology industry but also marks a notable expansion of its holdings in Beam Therapeutics, increasing its stake by 437,402 shares.

Located at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, State Street Corp is a prominent investment firm known for its robust portfolio management strategies. The firm manages a diverse array of assets, with a strong emphasis on technology and financial services sectors. Its top holdings include major corporations such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), highlighting its inclination towards innovation-driven companies. With an equity portfolio valued at approximately $2.285 trillion, State Street Corp continues to influence significant market movements through its investment choices.

Beam Therapeutics Inc, based in the USA, operates within the biotechnology industry and specializes in developing genetic medicines through its proprietary base editing technology. Since its IPO on February 6, 2020, Beam has been at the forefront of genetic medicine, offering innovative solutions across various therapeutic areas. Despite a challenging market, the company maintains a market capitalization of $2.01 billion, with a current stock price of $24.4, slightly below the transaction price.

Beam Therapeutics presents a mixed financial picture. The company's Profitability Rank is notably low at 1/10, and it currently operates at a loss, as indicated by a PE Percentage of 0.00. However, its balance sheet remains relatively strong with a Financial Strength rank of 6/10, supported by a cash to debt ratio of 6.10. Despite these challenges, Beam's revenue growth over the past three years has been impressive, ranking at the top of its industry.

The recent acquisition by State Street Corp significantly bolsters its position in Beam Therapeutics, reflecting a strategic investment in a sector with substantial growth potential. This move is particularly noteworthy given the current market conditions and the firm's portfolio strategy, which heavily favors technological and innovative market segments. The addition of Beam Therapeutics shares could potentially enhance the firm's portfolio diversification, aligning with its long-term investment philosophy.

The biotechnology sector is known for its high volatility and substantial growth potential. Beam Therapeutics' role in this sector is strengthened by its innovative genetic editing technology, which positions it well for future advancements.

This move reduced their holdings by 2.89%, bringing the total shares held to 2,372,237. The shares were traded at a price of $198.86 each. Despite this reduction, State Street Corp maintains a substantial position in Assurant, reflecting a 4.60% ownership in the company and a minor 0.02% portfolio position.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a globally recognized investment firm. With a vast portfolio of 4,172 stocks, the firm is a major player in the financial services and technology sectors. Their top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). State Street Corp's investment philosophy focuses on leveraging market trends and technological advancements to maximize returns. The firm's equity holdings amount to a staggering $2,285.63 trillion, underscoring its influential presence in the investment world.

Assurant Inc, with its diverse range of insurance products, operates primarily through its Global Housing and Global Lifestyle segments. The company, which went public on February 5, 2004, has a market capitalization of $10.26 billion and a stock price of $198.09. Assurant is currently rated as ""Fairly Valued"" with a GF Value of $183.95 and a price to GF Value ratio of 1.08. The company's profitability and growth metrics are robust, with a GF Score of 85/100, indicating a strong potential for future performance.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio

The recent sale of Assurant shares by State Street Corp, although minor in terms of their overall portfolio, reflects a strategic adjustment. This reduction might be indicative of risk management or portfolio rebalancing efforts, especially considering the firm's significant exposure to technology and financial services sectors.

Assurant has shown a commendable year-to-date stock price increase of 16.62% and an impressive 734.06% gain since its IPO. The company's financial health is solid, with a cash to debt ratio of 0.82 and an interest coverage of 10.14. These figures reflect Assurant's ability to cover its financial obligations while continuing to grow revenue and earnings, evidenced by a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.80%.

Other significant investors in Assurant include Gotham Asset Management, LLC, and Jefferies Group (Trades, Portfolio). State Street Corp's strategy in managing its Assurant holdings differs from these firms, which may be adopting a more bullish stance given the insurance industry's current dynamics. State Street Corp's investment strategy is heavily influenced by its dominant sectors: technology and financial services. The insurance industry, where Assurant operates, is undergoing significant transformations with technological integration and regulatory changes. State Street Corp's adjustment in its Assurant position might be a strategic move to align with broader market trends and optimize its portfolio performance in light of these industry shifts.

2024-10-17T18:04:45+00:00,"AAPL, MSFT, or GOOGL: Which Tech Company is the Better Buy this Earnings Season?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aapl-msft-googl-tech-company-180445275.html,"As earnings season approaches for big technology companies, I will compare Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) using the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to determine which stock is the best buy. While I hold a neutral outlook on Apple and a bullish outlook on both Microsoft and Alphabet, a closer analysis suggests that Microsoft may be the best choice heading into earnings.

I hold a neutral stance on Apple ahead of its earnings report on Oct. 31. My skepticism is due to what I view as overly optimistic revisions from Wall Street analysts, with 21 out of 25 raising earnings per share (EPS) estimates and 21 out of 24 boosting revenue projections over the past three months. The consensus expects EPS of $1.55 (up 6% year-over-year) and revenues of $94.23 billion (up 5.3%).

While the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, both capable of running artificial intelligence (AI), are key to Apple’s growth, initial sales of 37 million units fell 12.7% below the iPhone 15’s launch figures. The full potential of these devices, however, may not be realized until more AI features become available, delaying any AI-driven super cycle.

Apple’s performance in China will also be important this earnings season. Over the last nine months, Apple’s sales in China have dropped by 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in Fiscal Q3 compared to last year, reflecting a downward trend. While there was an expectation of demand recovery in Fiscal Q4 due to the iPhone 16 launch, the full impact is likely to materialize over the coming year when AI-driven updates become available.

Additionally, Apple’s Services segment should continue to post record revenues, benefiting from Apple’s ecosystem of 2.2 billion active iOS devices.

I rate Apple as a Hold ahead of its earnings, though I expect near-term growth to sustain the stock’s momentum, which is trading near all-time highs. Despite this, I see few catalysts that will enable the company to surpass the upwardly revised expectations.

Moreover, Apple’s options chains reflects some volatility, with an expected price swing ahead of earnings of 4.7% in either direction based on an at-the-money $230 strike price for options expiring on Nov. 1. The chart below illustrates the options chain.

At TipRanks, Apple’s Wall Street consensus is a Moderate Buy, with 23 out of 34 analysts recommending investors Buy the stock. The average price target is $248.90, suggesting potential upside of 7.99%.

I am bullish on Microsoft leading into earnings scheduled for Oct. 30. Despite beating expectations across the board with its previous financial results, that print did not positively impact MSFT stock. And, analysts have revised their projections downward for the upcoming Fiscal Q1 2025 earnings.

In the past three months, 15 of 21 analysts have lowered their EPS estimates, and all 26 have revised revenue projections for Fiscal Q1. Current expectations are for EPS of $3.10 (a 3.7% year-over-year increase) and revenues of $64.54 billion (up 14.2%). Last quarter, a major concern that hurt Microsoft was the announcement of increased infrastructure spending to meet growing demand. This spending is expected to pressure margins in the current Fiscal year. Additionally, the performance of the Intelligent Cloud segment, led by Azure, showed some moderation, with Azure growing by 22% year-over-year in the previous quarter. These revised estimates present a more tempered view, giving Microsoft an opportunity to meet or exceed expectations with its upcoming results. I rate Microsoft a Buy ahead of its earnings, believing that with lower expectations and more patient investors, the company’s strong cloud performance and sustained gross margins near 70% should be better appreciated. This could help the stock return to its all-time high of $468 per share reached in July of this year. However, the options chain below indicates significant volatility, with an expected price swing of 5.9% ahead of earnings, based on the at-the-money straddle for options expiring on Nov. 1, at a strike price of $412.50. At TipRanks, Microsoft has a Strong Buy rating from Wall Street, with 26 of 29 analysts rating it a Buy and an average price target of $503.13, suggesting potential upside of 21.84%. I have a positive outlook for Alphabet ahead of its Q3 earnings report on Oct. 29, as Wall Street expectations seem balanced and the company may exceed conservative guidance. Analysts have made 17 upward and 18 downward EPS revisions, along with 16 upward and 13 downward revenue revisions in the past three months. The target to beat is an EPS of $1.84 (up 19% year-over-year) and revenues of $86.23 billion (up 12.4% year-over-year). While Alphabet’s Q2 results beat expectations, YouTube’s ad revenue of $8.66 billion fell short of the $8.93 billion consensus, contributing to the mixed revisions. Management also cautioned that operating margins could be impacted by increased depreciation, higher infrastructure costs, and the pull-forward of hardware launches. Despite concerns about losing market share in Search due to rising AI competition, Google Search showed steady growth in this year’s second quarter, with double-digit growth expected to continue. Any potential weaknesses in YouTube or Search can be offset by Google Cloud, which experienced a 29% revenue increase in Q2, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of growth. I rate Alphabet as a Buy ahead of its earnings, as the stock has fallen nearly 13% since its Q2 report, which I believe to be somewhat of an overreaction. Alphabet appears well-positioned to deliver strong performance for the third quarter, supported by a more balanced market outlook. Compared to Apple and Microsoft, Alphabet’s options chains below shows the lowest volatility ahead of earnings. The expected price swing is 2.8% in either direction, based on the at-the-money straddle for options expiring on Nov. 1, calculated using a $165 strike price. According to TipRanks, Alphabet is rated a Strong Buy, with 39 analysts recommending Buy and nine recommending Hold. The average price target is $200.92, indicating potential upside of 21.48%. While analysts are revising estimates upward for Apple, making it harder to beat expectations in a transitional quarter, softer expectations for Microsoft and Alphabet create a better outlook for earnings beats. Though I consider both MSFT and GOOGL to be Buys, I believe Microsoft is the stronger choice as its stock likely has more room to run and it could easily beat modest earnings expectations.",AAPL,yes,eod,1375

Needham: By node, relative to Shi’s estimates, Taiwan Semiconductor’s third-quarter print shows a much more robust performance of 3nm and a slightly weaker performance of 5nm.

The analyst noted the 3nm upside should be primarily due to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). In contrast, 5nm revenue is leveling off after six consecutive quarters of strong sequential growth.

The gross margin performance, which is now back in the high 50s range, is a positive sign as Taiwan Semiconductor overcomes several cost challenges anticipated by management earlier this year, including 3nm dilution, 5nm to 3nm conversion cost, and electricity cost increases, he said.

Interestingly, the company had flagged 5nm and 3nm wafer prebuild as part of the reason for the gross margin upside, Shi added.

The analyst noted that Taiwan Semiconductor raised its full-year revenue growth target from “slightly above the mid-20s” to “close to 30%” while maintaining the 10% ex-memory semiconductor growth outlook.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects to triple AI revenue this year, which will account for mid-teens percent of its total revenue.

Based on management commentary, Shi estimates Taiwan Semiconductor’s AI revenue was around $4 billion in 2023 and will likely reach $13 billion in 2024.

Taiwan Semiconductor has guided AI to account for 20% of the total revenue by 2028, translating to ~$33 billion+ if the 15%+ total revenue CAGR continues through the next four years.

Taiwan Semiconductor’s reported revenue split between technology nodes suggests that the non-wafer revenue, the majority of which comes from packaging, saw a meaningful step up from $2.4 billion in the second quarter to $3.2 billion in the third quarter, a 36% increase sequentially.",AAPL,yes,eod,540

This transaction increased State Street Corp's total holdings in Wolfspeed to 6,694,555 shares, marking a substantial investment in the company. Despite the large number of shares purchased, this move did not have a significant immediate impact on State Street Corps overall portfolio, which remains diverse and robust.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent financial services provider with a strong focus on investment management. The firm manages a vast equity portfolio valued at approximately $2,285.63 trillion, predominantly in the technology and financial services sectors. State Street Corps top holdings include major corporations such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), reflecting its strategic focus on high-growth potential markets.

Wolfspeed Inc, trading under the symbol WOLF, specializes in the production of wide bandgap semiconductors, focusing on materials like silicon carbide and gallium nitride.

2024-10-17T16:05:45+00:00,Samsung says its AI tools have sparked a rise in people switching from iPhone,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-says-ai-tools-sparked-160545097.html,"Samsung has said a broad rollout of artificial intelligence tools to its mobile devices has sparked a rise in the number of people in the UK switching to the firm from Apple’s iPhone.

The Korean phone maker began rolling out its suite of AI tools – known as Galaxy AI – in January and has brought it to a range of phones and tablets, including the last three generations of its flagship S Series phones and its two most recent, lower priced, mid-range FE handsets.

In contrast, the Apple Intelligence suite of AI tools is yet to launch on the iPhone 16 range which went on sale last month, and will also only be accessible on the top tier iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max from last year’s range, as well as only two of its most recent tablets.

A Samsung UK executive said the company has seen a more than 40% rise in customers switching from Apple handsets to Samsung in the UK since it launched Galaxy AI.

A beta version of the Apple tools is due to roll out this month ahead of a launch in English in December, with other languages to follow over the next year.

But users in the EU are not currently set to be able to access the tools on iPhone or iPad, as Apple remains in a standoff with the European Union over new competition rules under the Digital Markets Act.

Annika Bizon, marketing and omnichannel director for mobile at Samsung UK and Ireland, told the PA news agency: “AI should be for everyone. We don’t believe in gatekeeping it for our most premium smartphones on the market.

“That’s why we are rolling it out to the broadest audience possible – bringing AI to tablets for the first time with the Tab S10 and launching the most affordable AI phone on the market with the S24 FE.

“People want to see tangible upgrades when they invest in a smartphone and we are seeing more people make the switch over to Samsung.

“In fact, in the UK we’ve seen a 42% increase in customers moving to us from iOS since launching Galaxy AI.”

Both companies’ suite of tools include AI-powered features to help with writing and editing text, image editing and generation, as well as recording, transcribing and summarising calls and audio.

Smartphone makers have started introducing the features in response to the generative AI boom sparked by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.",AAPL,yes,eod,474
2024-10-17T15:54:20+00:00,Chip stocks rally as TSMC forecasts strong AI demand for 'many years',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chip-stocks-rally-as-tsmc-forecasts-strong-ai-demand-for-many-years-155420433.html,"Several chipmaker stocks rallied on Thursday amid optimism over AI demand in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSM) blowout third quarter earnings.

AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) rose as much as 3%, at one point touching an all-time intraday high, as investors responded to TSMC's positive sentiment about artificial intelligence. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 1.3% before paring gains. Semiconductor firm Broadcom (AVGO) ended the day up 2.7%. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) rose up to 1.7%, though the stock later reversed direction. US-listed TSMC shares jumped 9.8%, pushing the company's market capitalization past the $1 trillion mark.

After underperforming the broader market earlier this week, the PHLX Semiconductor (^SOX) Index gained nearly 1% Thursday, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed flat.

TSMC manufactures artificial intelligence chips designed by Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices, and those chips are used in data centers to power AI software such as ChatGPT and other popular bots. TSMC on Thursday reported third-quarter profits 54% higher than last year and lifted its full year sales outlook. The raised guidance was largely driven by “extremely robust AI-related demand,” Wei said. The chip manufacturer expects AI revenue to more than triple in 2024.

TSMC is one of three companies capable of manufacturing AI chips that have been crucial to the massive wave of AI innovation following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022. The Taiwanese company dominates rivals Samsung (005930.KS) and Intel (INTC) in the AI semiconductor market. Aside from Nvidia and AMD, major TSMC customers include Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm, and Broadcom.

TSMC’s sunny third quarter earnings report and executives' commentary on artificial intelligence are welcome signs for angsty investors worried over the future of the AI space. Wall Street analysts have signaled concerns in recent months over the lack of a near-term return on investment for Big Tech firms spending massive sums on AI infrastructure. The worry is that tech companies could ease spending on AI hardware, causing a downturn in shares of companies like Nvidia and its supplier TSMC.

Those fears were on display earlier this week, when an AI equipment company’s woes prompted a rout in global chip stocks. Dutch tech giant ASML (ASME.DE) indicated in its third quarter earnings release this week that sales of its machines — which are used by TSMC to make Nvidia’s leading AI chips — would ease. Though ASML’s results were driven by geopolitical concerns and other factors unrelated to the AI chip market, easily-spooked investors sold off shares of Nvidia, AMD, and AVGO, with the stocks suffering sharp declines.

TSMC’s results Thursday helped those AI chip stocks partially recover from those losses. The AI chip market is set to grow 99% in 2024 and another 74% next year, according to consulting firm International Business Strategies, which tracks industry data. Meanwhile, the semiconductor market overall is projected to grow 18% this year and 12% in 2025. IBS data shows the AI chip market — also known as the accelerator chip market — outpacing the sector at large through 2030. Wall Street analysts on Thursday reiterated their Buy ratings on TSM. “[W]e recommend TSMC stock as a core holding for investors who look to invest in semiconductors, which we view as the foundation of the expanding digital economy,” Needham analyst Charles Shi wrote in a note to investors.

The Department of Justice could block Google (GOOGL) from being the default search engine on Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone as part of its antitrust victory against the tech giant.



In August, a federal judge ruled that Google monopolized the online search engine market. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF) said a “very likely” outcome could be that the Justice Department will opt to ban Google from paying Apple to be the exclusive search engine on the popular smartphone.

That could pose a major blow to Apple’s revenues. According to the analysts’ estimates, revenue from this deal is around $25 billion for the year, or about 6.3% of Apple’s revenue and a whopping 20% of its pretax profit.

This ban could take place over the course of several years and may not altogether prevent Google from having any revenue-sharing agreement with Apple. Instead, it would block the two tech giants from having an exclusive deal that would shut out other search engines.



Apple stock was flat as of Thursday morning, trading at $231.96 per share. The tech giant has a market capitalization of $3.52 trillion — the largest in the world.

Federal judge Amit Mehta said in his decision that Google’s exclusive agreements with companies like Apple allowed it to hike prices for advertisers without any blowback.

To address Google’s monopoly in the search engine market, the Justice Department said in a court filing earlier this month that it’s looking for remedies that would prevent and restrain any present and future maintenance of its dominance.

This would include “behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features” — which could also mean breaking up the company.

While the ruling and subsequent DOJ proposals have knock-on effects on the iPhone maker, Apple stock was largely unharmed by the ruling. Jefferies noted that the sales performance of the recently released iPhone 16 and rollout of its artificial intelligence features, Apple Intelligence, are more important short-term drivers.

The analysts said they are worried that market expectations for next year’s iPhone, the iPhone 17, are too high and that AI hardware tech on smartphones may have to wait until the iPhone 18 in 2026 to be fully developed.

2024-10-17T15:19:21+00:00,It turns out Apple was in cahoots with BYD on its secretive electric car project,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/turns-apple-cahoots-byd-secretive-151921692.html,"It turns out Apple was in cahoots with BYD on its secretive electric car project

For years, Apple was rumored to be working on a futuristic self-driving car, with the company tied to collaborations with Volkswagen and even a potential deal to buy McLaren at one point. That never happened and the project was canned after 10 years, but now it appears some of the tech developed by Apple’s car program has found its way into cars built by another automaker.



The American tech giant wasn’t in cahoots with VW or McLaren, it wasn’t even working with its supplier Foxconn on its increasing endeavors into the automotive world. No, Apple was instead working with Chinese EV maker BYD, reports Bloomberg.

The iPhone maker reportedly worked with Chinese automaker BYD “for years,” explains Bllomberg. The two companies co-developed long-range batteries that formed the basis for the kind of cells BYD uses in its models today:

Apple and the Shenzhen-based company teamed up around 2017 to build a battery system using lithium iron phosphate cells, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the effort hasn’t been disclosed. The technology was designed to be longer-range and safer than typical electric-vehicle batteries at the time. Though Apple doesn’t own any of the technology used in BYD’s current Blade batteries, the partnership shows just how far the iPhone maker went in its efforts to produce a car. The tech titan spent roughly $1 billion a year over the past decade on the vehicle project — often seen as one of the company’s “next big things” — before scrapping it in February. The technology that Apple developed with BYD would have been highly customized for the once-planned vehicle, according to the people. As part of the secret partnership, Apple engineers brought expertise in advanced battery packs and heat management, they said. BYD contributed manufacturing know-how and advancements using lithium iron phosphate cells — better known as LFP.

BYD now uses the Blade battery tech across its entire lineup of electric cars, with a spokesperson for the company telling Bloomberg that it “holds complete property rights and patent rights for the Blade battery.”

The tech is set apart in the way it arranges the lithium iron phosphate cells that BYD uses in its cars, explains Autoevolution. This was Apple’s contribution to the project, the site reports, as it follows a similar method to how the tech giant stacks cells in products like its laptops:

Apple reportedly backed away from the collaboration with BYD and looked across the auto industry for another battery partner to work with. The search was short-lived, however, and the tech giant canned its quest to build a car of its own earlier this year after 10 years of work on the project.

The benchmark topped 43,000 for the first time early this week and is up 14.3% so far this year. 



SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, which tracks the Dow Jones Index, has gained 15% this year. While most of the stocks in the ETF portfolio have been rising over the past week, we have highlighted five that have been leading the way higher. These are JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, Honeywell International Inc. HON, McDonald’s MCD and Apple Inc. AAPL.



The third-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start, with companies beating estimates and providing a reassuring comment on underlying economic trends. Total earnings for the 48 S&P 500 members that have reported third-quarter results so far are up 5.2% on 4.9% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 72.9% beating revenue estimates. This is a better beat ratio than the group of companies seen in other recent periods (read: 5 Sector ETFs to Bet on This Earnings Season).



Additionally, the latest blockbuster jobs and inflation report renewed investors’ confidence in the economy's health. The jobs data showed the biggest jump in six months in September, a fall in the unemployment rate and a solid wage increase, all pointing to a resilient economy. The United States added 254,000 jobs last month, up from a revised 159,000 in August, and unemployment dipped to 4.1% from 4.2% in August. Meanwhile, inflation cooled down to 2.4% in September, down from 2.5% recorded in August and in line with market expectations of 2.3%-2.4%. The inflation rate peaked at a 41-year high of 8.9% in June 2022.



Further, the Fed rate cut cycle benefited the stocks. Lower rates primarily benefit cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. Being highly exposed to cyclical sectors, the blue-chip index is set to outperform from this trend. Lower rates generally lead to reduced borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other consumer and business loans. This helps businesses to expand their operations more easily, resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, stimulates economic growth and boosts the stock market.

SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with an AUM of $37 billion and an average daily volume of 3 million shares. It tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, holding 30 stocks in its basket, with each making up for less than 8.6% share. Financials (23.7%), information technology (19.2%), healthcare (17.8%), consumer discretionary (15.3%) and industrials (13.7%) are the top five sectors.

• The chart of the day

If the summer was about the ROI on AI, or really, the absence of it, how much patience does Wall Street have for tech’s fall earnings?

Judging by the surge in chip stocks, investors waiting for details about where all that infrastructure money is going and when new revenue will be coming will have to wait a while longer. An appreciating asset is its own defense.

As analysts press tech executives for clearer timelines around the supposed AI transformation, chip names continue to climb. Nvidia is once again threatening Apple as the market’s most valuable company. Semiconductor names are amassing gains, reversing a downfall from August. And on Wednesday, the rally fired up again after chip industry bellwether TSMC's (TSM) strong AI-fueled sales forecast.

That reflects the intense demand for AI processing and infrastructure and a disregard for short-term worries over ballooning capex. Chasing the dream is expensive.

And once again investors are wondering where the limit is — if it exists.

Third quarter reports are primed to test those boundaries with even more money at stake. The longer the capex hose stays open and the more vehemently executives fuse their identities with the AI wave, the harder it will be to turn back. Megacap tech companies are expected to dedicate $215 billion to AI capital expenditures this year, and according to Goldman Sachs, another $250 billion in 2025.

A slowdown in investment isn’t here yet. But we’ll be looking for clues on how long AI growth will last until company whims, preferences, and future spending start to reveal themselves on spreadsheets. It’s only a matter of time before the imagined productivity gains and “innovative AI use cases” come due.

The tight, symbiotic ecosystem of selling AI hardware suggests that as soon as Big Tech eases spending or pivots elsewhere, previously robust fundamentals might be destabilized.

The tech giants largely disappointed Wall Street last quarter. Only Meta came out with a clear victory. While reactions to earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) highlighted how heavy AI investment can become a liability, Zuckerberg showed that Wall Street doesn’t mind swelling capex, as long as every other part of the business is exceeding expectations. That’s a high bar to clear. And it will only get harder as the spending side of the ledger gets bigger without surefire revenue to offset it.

Seeing past risk is a virtue at the top of the corporate ladder. So is suppressing bubble chatter. If the upward trajectory of chip stocks is a bellwether then the tech giants will continue to double down on their mega disbursements. That’s what we would expect from tenacious leadership.

2024-10-17T09:50:00+00:00,Billionaire Ken Griffin's Top 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks: Are They Buys Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-ken-griffins-top-3-095000080.html,"Ken Griffin subscribes to the theory that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket. His Citadel hedge fund's portfolio includes over 5,800 holdings. How has this highly diversified strategy worked out for Griffin? Quite well, considering he's currently worth roughly $43 billion.

With such a big portfolio, it's not surprising that Griffin owns positions in many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Here are his top three AI stocks -- and whether or not they're good picks to buy now.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) ranks as the largest individual stock holding for Griffin and his third-largest holding overall (after two exchange-traded funds). As of June 30, 2024, his hedge fund owned 7.69 million shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant worth around $1.49 billion. Griffin remains bullish about Amazon, increasing his stake in the stock by nearly 17% in the second quarter of 2024.

AI permeates practically every part of Amazon's business. The company uses AI to recommend products for online buyers. Its Alexa is one of the most popular AI assistants. Amazon incorporates AI into its search, boosting e-commerce sales. AI helps the company optimize its warehouse operations. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a wide array of AI tools to customers.

Sure, Amazon (like several of its peers) seemed to be initially caught off-guard by the rapid rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT. AWS also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud in providing cloud services.

However, Griffin is smart to have invested so heavily in Amazon, in my opinion. The company is a leader in AI with the resources to remain among the strongest players. Despite the challenges from Microsoft and Google Cloud, AWS remains the top cloud services provider. I think Amazon stock is still one of the best AI picks around.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) trails behind Amazon as Griffin's second-largest individual stock holding. Citadel owned 5.47 million shares of the iPhone maker worth $1.15 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2024. This reflected aggressive buying by Griffin in Q2: He increased his hedge fund's position in Apple by 93%.

I suspect that AI was a major reason why Griffin added so much to Citadel's stake in Apple. The company at long last introduced its generative AI capabilities, which it calls Apple Intelligence. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that Apple Intelligence could ignite a supercycle of iPhone upgrades that provide a big tailwind for Apple.

Others aren't so optimistic, though. They think Apple's slow rollout of its generative AI features could backfire. Even if Apple Intelligence does drive incremental growth, much of it could already be baked into Apple's share price with the stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of close to 30.

I agree to some extent with the skeptics who slam Apple's staggered introduction of its Apple Intelligence capabilities. My hunch is we won't see an overwhelming kick-off of an upgrade supercycle this year. However, I nonetheless expect iPhone sales will increase with momentum potentially accelerating in 2026 and 2027. Apple isn't a slam-dunk near-term pick, in my view, but it's still a stock worth buying for long-term investors. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is Griffin's third-largest AI position and ranks in Citadel's top 10 holdings overall. At the end of Q2, the hedge fund owned 4.84 million shares of the semiconductor and infrastructure software company worth $776.7 million. Griffin increased Citadel's position in Broadcom by roughly 64% in Q2. AI is a huge growth driver for Broadcom. CEO Hock Tan said in September that the company expects to generate $12 billion from AI in fiscal year 2024. That estimate reflects 23% of Broadcom's projected total full-year revenue. The company has recently launched multiple new AI infrastructure products, including ethernet networking switches designed to accelerate AI workloads. However, Broadcom's growth story isn't as rosy as you might think. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of VMware, the company's revenue increased by only 4% year over year in the latest quarter. But Griffin is bullish about Broadcom. So is Wall Street, with 27 of 29 analysts surveyed by LSEG in October recommending the stock as a ""buy"" or a ""strong buy."" I agree with the consensus: Broadcom is a great AI stock to buy and hold. Where to invest $1,000 right now When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-10-17T09:36:00+00:00,"Meet The Low-Cost Vanguard ETF That Has 20% Of Its Holdings in Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-low-cost-vanguard-etf-093600568.html,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is surging once again, passing Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to become the second most valuable U.S.-based company behind Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Nvidia's new Blackwell graphics processing unit architecture could deliver significant performance improvements and cost efficiency, which would be a win for Nvidia and its customers.

Folks looking to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) could simply buy Nvidia stock as a catch-all way to play a rise in computing power demand. But there are also exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to consider.

With a more than 20% stake in Nvidia, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT) stands out as an excellent way to invest in the semiconductor industry without racking up high fees.

The technology sector is, by far, the largest sector in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) -- making up 31.7% of the index. One look at its top holdings and it is easy to see why.

Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom have a combined market cap of over $10.5 trillion -- making the sector very top-heavy.

And while the tech sector used to be dominated by software and hardware companies, semiconductors are now the largest industry within the sector, making up 28.9% of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.

So, while investors could turn to pure-play semiconductor funds like the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may be a better long-term investment. For starters, the iShares Semiconductor ETF has a 0.35% expense ratio compared to just 0.1% for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.

The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, making an ETF that focuses only on chip stocks volatile.

With the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, an investor gains access to the infrastructure and processing might that is powering AI, as well as AI-driven tools like those deployed by software companies Microsoft, Adobe, or Apple phones with AI chips.

Factors to consider before buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF

The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a great way to invest in today's top tech companies. However, its greatest drawbacks are that it offers little exposure to smaller companies (given the size of the largest tech companies), and it leaves out some important names that you may think are in the tech sector.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Google's parent company, Alphabet, are in the communications sector. So you won't find these four names in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. Amazon Web Services is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure -- which is critical for running global AI models. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has arguably been the single best example of a company investing heavily in AI (and buying a lot of Nvidia chips) and showing why those investments are paying off. Vanguard offers a low-cost mega-cap growth fund that targets top growth stocks regardless of their sector. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) may be a better fit for investors who want less exposure to tech stocks and better coverage of the largest growth stocks by market cap. Let ETFs work for you Nvidia has captured the spotlight as the leader in AI innovation in the semiconductor space. Still, some investors may prefer AMD as an underdog that could take market share from Nvidia over time. Meanwhile, Broadcom offers a nice blend of value, growth, and income, given its diversified business and growing dividend. The fact that the tech sector has a 20% weighting in these three stocks alone shows how valuable these companies have become. Buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a simple way to add to your exposure to these three names and the rest of the semiconductor industry. It's also an excellent way to avoid the risks of betting on a single company to invest in AI or another trend. The best way to approach individual stocks and ETFs is to use them to suit your interests, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. Investors who closely follow the sector may prefer to build their tech portfolio around chip stocks and leave out the big software names. But folks looking for a low-cost passive approach may prefer the hands-off nature of simply buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and resting easy knowing it is chock-full of semiconductor stocks -- so they won't miss out if the industry continues to soar higher.

2024-10-17T09:09:45+00:00,TSMC Hikes Revenue Outlook in Show of Confidence in AI Boom,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-profit-beats-estimates-during-054637777.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares hit a record high after the chipmaker topped quarterly estimates and raised its target for 2024 revenue growth, allaying concerns about global chip demand and the sustainability of an AI hardware boom.

• Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says
• Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes

The company — the main chip manufacturer for Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. — now expects sales to climb roughly 30% in US dollar terms this year, up from previous projections for an increase in the mid-20% range. That’s after TSMC reported better-than-predicted earnings for the September quarter. And it foresees capital expenditure rising in 2025 from roughly $30 billion this year.

TSMC’s American depositary receipts rose 9.8% in New York, reaching their highest level since the securities began trading in the US in October 1997. Nvidia’s stock, meanwhile, rose less than 1%. Shares of Japanese chip gear makers including Lasertec Corp. pared losses in Tokyo, while Infineon Technologies AG rose in Europe alongside sector peers.

TSMC’s outlook should help tamp down concerns that investors misjudged AI and semiconductor demand. Those fears crystallized after chip industry linchpin ASML Holding NV stunned markets by reporting about half the orders investors had expected. On Thursday, TSMC Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei sought to dispel those doubts.

“The demand is real and I believe it’s just the beginning,” Wei said, echoing a number of executives including Nvidia’s CEO. In terms of overall chip demand, “everything’s stabilized and start to improve.”

TSMC’s shares have surged more than 70% this year, outpacing many of Asia’s biggest tech firms in a reflection of strong sales of the Nvidia chips vital to artificial intelligence development.

Taiwan’s largest company had raised its outlook for 2024 revenue just a few months ago in July, underscoring expectations for spending on AI infrastructure from the likes of Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. Steady adoption of artificial intelligence should also help fuel sales of iPhones and other gadgets in the long run.

Still, investors had watched for deviations in TSMC’s outlook after ASML blamed slower-than-expected recovery in the automotive, mobile and PC markets for stalling chip plant expansion plans. AI remains a bright spot, its executives said.

“TSMC is not just an AI machine,” said Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “They are much better positioned than both Intel and Samsung, which have had their own well-documented issues. TSMC has positioned itself well and should any real downturn hit the sector, it should be in a strong position to weather this and emerge in a good place.” The results show “no end in sight to AI-derived strength,” Wedbush analysts wrote in a note while raising their price target and reiterating their rating of outperform. TSMC’s 57%-plus gross-margin guidance for 4Q (vs. consensus’ 54.7%) — coupled with the fast ramp-up of N3-node revenue — indicates still-strong demand for its AI chips from Nvidia and others, consistent with our view. Sales growth of about 25% in 2025 looks feasible, based on our calculations, supported by TSMC’s leadership in 3- and 5-nm nodes, and its advanced CoWoS proprietary semiconductor packaging technology. Click here for the research. On Thursday, TSMC reported a better-than-projected 54% rise in September-quarter net profit to NT$325.3 billion ($10.1 billion). And it expects revenue of $26.1 billion to $26.9 billion in the final quarter, beating an estimate for $24.9 billion. The world’s largest maker of advanced chips has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of a global race to develop artificial intelligence. Its shares have more than doubled since that boom took off in late 2022 with the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. TSMC’s market capitalization briefly crossed the $1 trillion mark in the US. Yet even before ASML, some investors have grown cautious about the trajectory of global AI spending. They question whether big tech firms like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. will continue to splash out on chips and data centers without a truly killer application. All About Nvidia Chips, AI Hype and What Lies Ahead: QuickTake The risks of data center over-capacity and geopolitical issues have unnerved some investors. Bloomberg reported this week that Biden administration officials have discussed capping sales of advanced AI chips from Nvidia and other American companies on a country-specific basis. On Thursday, Wei said he expects revenue from AI server processors to more than triple this year, yielding a mid-teens percentage of total sales in 2024. It’s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That’s on top of construction underway in Japan, Arizona and Germany. --With assistance from Vlad Savov, Cindy Wang, Mayumi Negishi, Lianting Tu, Henry Ren and Subrat Patnaik.

2024-10-16T22:03:07+00:00,Apple Secretly Worked With China’s BYD on Long-Range EV Battery,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-secretly-worked-china-byd-220307915.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. worked with Chinese automaker BYD Co. for years as part of its now-canceled car project, developing long-range batteries that helped lay the groundwork for technology used today, according to people familiar with the situation.
• How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain

Apple and the Shenzhen-based company teamed up around 2017 to build a battery system using lithium iron phosphate cells, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the effort hasn’t been disclosed. The technology was designed to be longer-range and safer than typical electric-vehicle batteries at the time.

Though Apple doesn’t own any of the technology used in BYD’s current Blade batteries, the partnership shows just how far the iPhone maker went in its efforts to produce a car. The tech titan spent roughly $1 billion a year over the past decade on the vehicle project — often seen as one of the company’s “next big things” — before scrapping it in February.

The technology that Apple developed with BYD would have been highly customized for the once-planned vehicle, according to the people. As part of the secret partnership, Apple engineers brought expertise in advanced battery packs and heat management, they said. BYD contributed manufacturing know-how and advancements using lithium iron phosphate cells — better known as LFP.

Spokespeople for Apple and BYD declined to comment on the joint battery work. But BYD said in an emailed statement that “the concept for the Blade battery originated with BYD engineers, who independently developed this LFP Blade battery. BYD holds complete property rights and patent rights for the Blade battery.”

Today, BYD’s entire car lineup is powered by the Blade system, which uses a battery pack design that people involved in its development say was informed by lessons from the Apple work.

The seeds of Apple’s BYD collaboration were planted about a decade ago, when the US company was seeking core technologies for its car. BYD engineers previewed early versions of the Blade battery to Apple executives, who admired the technology’s safety and energy storage capabilities. Apple ultimately sought customizations that could enhance the range of an EV, the people said.

At the time, Cupertino, California-based Apple had already been working on several different batteries, using elements like nickel and alkaline. It had also been investing millions of dollars in battery pack design and engineering to squeeze in as many cells as possible. The two companies sought to combine the separate pack and cell efforts to produce a safe, long-range battery system for the Apple vehicle.

On the Apple side, the tie-up was led by Alexander Hitzinger, a former senior Volkswagen AG and Porsche executive who oversaw product design for the car project from 2016 to 2019. The company also had enlisted Mujeeb Ijaz, a veteran of the failed American battery startup A123 Systems LLC who worked at Apple from 2014 to 2020. Ijaz oversaw a team of about 50 battery engineers working on the project. His counterpart at BYD was Michael He, vice president of the company’s battery business. The Blade is now a signature feature in BYD cars — and a major selling point. The company used its improved range, relative safety and lower cost to generate sales of 3 million electric and hybrid vehicles in 2023, up from 179,054 three years earlier. It’s now the biggest automaker in China by sales and briefly surpassed Tesla Inc. to become the top seller of EVs globally. BYD founder and Chairman Wang Chuanfu, a battery engineer himself, is a billionaire. Despite years of working with BYD, Apple backed away from the partnership and considered systems from other battery makers, the people said. The overall car project suffered numerous delays, and the economics of the EV business eventually proved too daunting. When Apple canceled the car project, it marked a rare high-profile failure for the world’s most valuable company. But the decade-long endeavor did prove useful in some ways. Beyond the battery insights gleaned from the effort, it helped with the development of products such as the Vision Pro headset and the Neural Engine AI processor now present in most Apple devices. The work also has contributed to the company’s nascent push into robotics.

2024-10-16T21:31:10+00:00,"Justice Department will ‘very likely’ kill Google’s billion-dollar deal to be the default search engine on iPhones, Jefferies predicts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/justice-department-very-likely-kill-213110571.html,"Analysts at Jefferies say it’s “very likely” the U.S. Department of Justice will ban Google’s longtime search deal on iPhones, a decision Jefferies predicts could sink Apple’s stock by as much as 11%.

Google has been at the center of the biggest antitrust trial in decades, as the DOJ questions practices that have kept the search engine front and center on smartphones and web browsers. Google has paid billions to Apple and others annually to have a prominent spot on devices up until now, but Jefferies analysts on Wednesday predicted the DOJ would ban those deals in the future as it tries to break up any search monopoly. Jefferies estimates the $25 billion deal makes up 20% of Apple’s pretax profit, or about 6.3% of total revenue, representing an 8% to 11% hit on share prices.

These deals have taken place since 2002 when Google first paid Apple a cut of its search advertising revenue to make Google the default search platform. According to the Financial Times, that gave Google access to Apple’s user base, with more than half of all search queries in the U.S. today currently flowing through Apple devices.

During the trial, DOJ lawyers argued that Google’s practice of paying billions to secure its position on platforms like Apple blocks competitors and prevents innovation. Google has repeatedly countered that its dominance stems from consumer preference and users can easily switch to other search engines if they wish. However, DOJ prosecutors contend that the sheer scale of these payments reveals the lengths to which Google goes to maintain its monopoly.

Even if the DOJ does end these deals, the effects may take time to materialize. Jefferies estimates it could take three to eight years for a final outcome in court, with the possibility of long appeals. Jefferies also called its own estimates “pessimistic,” noting they are part of a model in which there is zero offset in revenue by Apple. If the case is indeed tied up for years, as Jefferies predicts, Apple has plenty of time to course-correct and make up for any potential lost revenue. Jefferies also added the impact could be contained to the U.S. only, depending on the reaction from Europe to any DOJ decision.

Representatives from Jefferies, Apple, and Google did not immediately reply to Fortune's request for comment.

In the meantime, Apple’s stock price has remained relatively resilient, bolstered by investor optimism about upcoming products like the iPhone 17 as well as new AI-powered technologies.

Still, should the DOJ block the Google-Apple deal, it will mark a significant shift for both companies and could force Apple to explore its own search engine or deeper AI integrations—a path that carries its own risks. For Google, the stakes are equally high, if not higher. This case could fundamentally disrupt the company’s ability to use financial agreements to dominate the search-engine market.

The outcome of the case would also trigger ripple effects across the broader tech landscape, potentially opening doors for competitors such as Microsoft. As regulators around the globe keep a close eye on this case, it’s clear that both Google and Apple stand at the crossroads of a legal decision that could reshape their futures.

Carol Surface, who started at Apple in early 2023 and reports to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, is departing, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move hasn’t been announced. Apple employees were notified of the exit on Wednesday, they said.

When Surface joined Apple, she took over the people role from Deirdre O’Brien, who had been managing that team in addition to the company’s retail stores. With Surface’s departure, O’Brien will return to her prior role of running both groups.

Though Surface remains listed on Apple’s executive biographies website as of Wednesday afternoon, a spokesperson for Apple confirmed the moves.

The chief people officer title was created for Surface, who was tasked with overseeing human resources, inclusion, diversity and recruiting for Apple’s roughly 160,000 employees. She previously held a similar role at Medtronic Plc, a health technology company.

Surface had been part of a group of fewer than 20 executives reporting to Cook, who is dealing with a broader changing of the guard at the Cupertino, California-based technology giant.

At the end of this year, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri is stepping down from that role — though he’s staying on to oversee a smaller array of functions, including real estate and information systems. Dan Riccio, a longtime senior engineering executive who shepherded the Vision Pro, retires this month. Dan Rosckes, the company’s procurement chief, is also exiting. And Matt Fischer, Apple’s App Store head, is leaving in October as well.

The company’s HR organization has seen other changes recently, with its prior head of diversity and inclusion leaving earlier this year. She was replaced by Cynthia Bowman, who joined from Bank of America Corp.

Surface’s quick departure is rare for executives at her level of seniority. A few years ago, Apple named a new vice president of communications who left after only a matter of months. The company also employed retail chief John Browett for less than a year, but that was more than a decade ago.",AAPL,yes,eod,488

Targeting Google's partnerships with smartphone manufacturers including Apple, the lawsuit is likely to have major financial reprecussions should the case result in changes in revenue-sharing rules. According to Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, the legal procedure could potentially take up to three to eight years to clear out, with Apple losing one-third of its U.S. Google income. Lee highlighted that, while the potential income loss remains alarming, and in the near-term sales of the iPhone 16 and the introduction of Apple Intelligence have become critical. With around half of Apple's yearly profits coming from the iPhone, it is still the biggest revenue source for the business. Despite the antitrust concerns, Apple's core products are likely to be at the top of the priority list for investors at this point.

2024-10-16T19:16:14+00:00,"Jim Cramer On Apple Inc. (AAPL): ‘I Always Say Own it, Don’t Trade It’",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-apple-inc-aapl-191614818.html,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.

On Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique ""Poltergeist 2 magic.""

Cramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.

He noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.

Cramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:

Cramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.

For this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Cramer discussed insights from JPMorgan and Evercore regarding why investors should consider buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, arguing that negativity surrounding the company might be overblown ahead of its earnings report. “Today, two firms, JPMorgan and Evercore, talked about why you need to buy Apple. Both pieces stress that maybe people have gotten too bearish on the stock ahead of the earnings. So we might need to rethink all that negativity and just buy the darn thing. I mean, it's bizarre that so many people are so eager to hate the stock of one of the greatest companies in history, especially when the stock's been such a great long-term performer. Quizzical, isn't it? Cramer noted that the analysts from JPMorgan and Evercore are taking a more optimistic stance. He also emphasized the importance of owning the stock for the long term rather than trading it. “So many analysts have now shaded down their estimates for Apple that, get this, if business is simply okay, the estimates will prove to be too low. So these two bold analysts at JP Morgan [and] Evercore wanted to take the other side of the trade, the positive side. Plus, many of the objections to Apple may not hold as much water as they did even a couple [of] weeks ago. For example, we know a lot of people were worried about Chinese demand, but get this, if the Chinese government's actually able to stimulate, right, the stimulus plan starts working well, don't you think that China's issues are a smaller concern, more money for consumers in China means more orders for the prestigious iPhone. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), known primarily for its iconic iPhone, remains one of the most reputable companies in history and is on the brink of a significant upgrade cycle driven by advancements in artificial intelligence. In September, the company introduced a suite of AI-powered features branded as Apple Intelligence. The new offering aims to advance the functionality of the latest iPhones, iPads, and Macs, providing users with tools that facilitate quick writing and summarizing of texts and emails, photo editing, and the creation of personalized images. While the new features were not ready for public release at the launch of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro last month, anticipation is building for the upcoming iOS 18.1, which is expected to be available on October 28. The latest operating system will integrate Apple Intelligence, further expanding the capabilities of Apple devices and promising to improve the user experience significantly. Overall AAPL ranks 5th on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

2024-10-16T19:04:11+00:00,State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in PulteGroup Inc Holdings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corps-strategic-reduction-190411617.html,"State Street Corp, a prominent financial services firm, recently adjusted its investment in PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM), marking a significant transaction in its portfolio. On September 30, 2024, the firm reduced its stake by 4,106 shares, resulting in a new total of 10,532,595 shares held. This move adjusted the firm's position in PulteGroup to 5.10% of its holdings, reflecting a subtle yet strategic portfolio realignment. The shares were traded at a price of $143.53, during a period when the stock was noted as significantly overvalued based on GuruFocus metrics.

Headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, State Street Corp is a global leader in financial services, managing an equity portfolio worth approximately $2,285.63 trillion. The firm is heavily invested in technology and financial services, with top holdings including giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). State Street Corp's investment philosophy focuses on leveraging institutional expertise to manage diverse asset classes on a large scale.

PulteGroup Inc, a key player in the U.S. homebuilding sector, caters to various buyer segments including entry-level, move-up, and active adults. Besides construction, the company extends its services to mortgage financing and insurance, contributing to its comprehensive financial services segment. As of the latest data, PulteGroup boasts a market capitalization of $30.53 billion, with a PE ratio of 11.22, indicating profitability in its operations.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio

The recent transaction denotes a minor reduction, impacting only 0.07% of State Street Corp's total portfolio. This adjustment reflects a strategic decision, possibly due to the stock's current valuation being significantly overvalued with a GF Value of $82.39 and a price to GF Value ratio of 1.78. Such a move could be part of a broader risk management or sector reallocation strategy within the firm's investment framework.

PulteGroup's stock has shown robust growth with a year-to-date increase of 44.85%. The stock's performance since its IPO has been stellar, with an increase of 122,483.33%. However, the current GF Value suggests that the stock might not have much room for upward movement, being tagged as significantly overvalued. The GF Score of 87 indicates good potential for future performance, supported by strong financial health and profitability metrics.

Notable investors like Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) and Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) also hold positions in PulteGroup, indicating its popularity in the investment community. Muhlenkamp & Co Inc holds the largest share, underscoring the stock's appeal to diverse investment strategies. The homebuilding and construction industry faces various macroeconomic challenges, yet companies like PulteGroup continue to thrive due to strong market demand and efficient operational models. The firm's strategic positioning within the financial services segment also provides a competitive edge, enhancing its market resilience and growth prospects. In conclusion, State Street Corp's recent portfolio adjustment in PulteGroup Inc reflects a calculated approach to asset management, aligning with broader market valuations and internal investment strategies. As the market evolves, the firm's adept adjustments will be crucial in maintaining portfolio health and achieving investment objectives.

2024-10-25 18:40:09,"Cramer's week ahead: Earnings from Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/25/cramers-week-ahead-earnings-from-alphabet-meta-apple-microsoft-and-amazon.html,"With massive corporations including Alphabet , Meta , Apple , Microsoft and Amazon set to report earnings next week, CNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday urged investors to keep a level head. He also said not to forget about the nonfarm payroll report next Friday, where a weak hiring result could urge the Federal Reserve to keep cutting rates.

""Huge opportunity,"" he said. ""Just please remember, the first move's been the wrong move almost half the time since this earnings season began. Wait to process the numbers and listen to the conference calls before you pull the trigger.""

Monday starts off the week with earnings from Ford . Cramer said he wishes the automaker giant will report a clean quarter with no issues from warranty costs and not too much lost on electric vehicles.

Tuesday brings McDonald's earnings report, and Cramer said to expect ""a full airing of the e-coli situation,"" but that it is too early to tell how much damage it will do to the fast food chain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states. 



Cramer predicts Royal Caribbean , Reddit and PayPal to all report a large beat and raise in year-end guidance.

Alphabet will report after the close on Tuesday. While the tech behemoth's stock has been all over the map, Cramer said it has been ""rarely in a good way."" He said Alphabet is a great company, but not a solid stock as the leadership doesn't seem to prioritize what investors want to hear. 



Cramer said he believes Advanced Micro Devices will do well enough to take parts of Nvidia's business. Chipotle will report its earnings for the first time since former-CEO Brian Niccol's left the helm to run Starbucks , and Cramer said he believes announcing a permanent CEO would help the stock.

Another large slate of reports are set for Wednesday, including Caterpillar and Eli Lilly . Cramer said he saw the former's machines all over Chevron's floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico, but isn't sure whether the likely strong report will be enough to move the already hot stock. The latter has had a strong run on the back of the GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, and Cramer said a Stifel report on the negative impact weight-loss drugs may have on food stock means Eli Lilly stocks will benefit. 



Meta and Microsoft will dominate the after-the-bell reports, and while Cramer said he believes Meta can continue its phenomenal quarterly run, he isn't too sure whether Microsoft will be able to convince investors that its AI-tool Copilot is as strong as advertised. Two more companies Cramer said will likely show a hot quarter, Booking Holding and DoorDash , will shed more light on consumers prior to the nonfarm payroll report.

The monster week for earnings will continue into Thursday, as both Apple and Amazon will report after the bell. Even after the lackluster iPhone 16 launch, Cramer said ""we've seen this movie before"" with the company and the best strategy is to hold on. 



Another moment not to panic, he said Amazon is doing well and not to dogpile on the potential hammering the stock received last quarter. Cramer said he believes two drug stocks, Merck and Bristol-Myers , are too low, but if Friday brings a weak employment number then they are two stocks investors should not have bought.

On Friday, the nonfarm payroll report will be released, and Cramer said he ""can't stress how important this number is."" He said continued strong employment will mean no November interest rate cut, and even though some investors will want to sell, fed rate cut cycles are times to buy. Oil titans Chevron and Exxon will report the same day. 



Cramer said he was impressed on his trip by the way Chevron's returned a huge amount of capital in dividends and buybacks even though it is still the worst performer in the group. He also said Exxon is more loved than Chevron from the battle over the Hess acquisition, even as Exxon doesn't have as much earnings power, and suggested people should switch sides.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,838

2024-10-25 16:03:24,Apple Stock Vs. Alphabet Stock: Which Magnificent 7 Stock Performs Better In The Long Run?,https://www.benzinga.com/tech/24/10/41555871/apple-stock-vs-alphabet-stock-which-magnificent-7-stock-performs-better-in-the-long-run,"Apple Inc AAPL and Alphabet GOOGGOOGL are rivals, partners and members of the Magnificent 7.

While both stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five and 10 years, one has performed significantly better.

Rivals and Partners: Apple and Alphabet are both smartphone companies competing against each other for market share in the lucrative growth market.

While the companies compete against each other for smartphone market share, Alphabet also pays Apple for being the official search provider on iPhones.

This lucrative deal, which is worth an estimated $25 billion and could make up 6% of Apple's revenue could be under pressure with the U.S. Department of Justice looking into antitrust allegations for Alphabet's Google search division.

Stock Performance: In 2024, Apple outperformed Alphabet for stock returns. Here's a look at the historical stock price returns for Apple, Alphabet and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, which tracks the S&P 500.

The chart shows that Alphabet trails the S&P 500 on a year-to-date and one-year basis, while Apple ranks ahead of the S&P 500 on all metrics.

Looking at the five-year and 10-year performances, Apple has significantly outperformed Alphabet.

Financials: Both Apple and Alphabet are among the top revenue-producing companies on an annual basis and bring in plenty of net income, which translates to strong earnings per share year after year.

In fiscal 2023, Apple had revenue of $383.3 billion and net income of $97.0 billion. Alphabet posted revenue of $307.4 billion and net income of $74.0 billion.

While Apple had the higher revenue total for the last full fiscal year, the company posted a 2.8% year-over-year decline for revenue. Alphabet posted a 9% year-over-year increase for revenue.

Going forward, both stocks will be closely watched for who has the higher growth and better stock performance.

Both stocks have dividend yields of less than 1%, which likely doesn't make the stocks as attractive for dividend investors.

For value investors, both stocks trade at high multiple, but it is Alphabet who currently trades at the lower price-to-earnings multiple of 23.68, versus Apple's 35.43.

AAPL, GOOGL Price Action: Apple stock trades at $231.57 at the time of writing versus a 52-week trading range of $164.08 to $237.49.

Alphabet stock trades at $165.01 at the time of writing versus a 52-week trading range of $120.21 to $191.75.

2024-10-25 11:14:04,Missouri AG probing Google for allegedly ‘manipulating search results' ahead of 2024 election,https://nypost.com/2024/10/25/business/google-manipulating-search-results-ahead-of-2024-election-missouri-ag/,"Google faces an investigation by the Missouri attorney general for allegedly “manipulating search results” and exhibiting anti-conservative bias ahead of the 2024 election.

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said he will issue subpoenas to “get to the bottom of what appears to be election interference by Google,” a spokesperson for the Republican told The Post on Friday.

Bailey will be seeking information about the black-box algorithm that powers Google search — which has come under fire from Donald Trump leading up to the election for yielding mostly negative articles about the Republican presidential candidate.

“Evidence has come to light that Google is de-emphasizing conservative speech or content — such as putting conservative reporting on Page 11 rather than Page 1 — by manipulating search results,” the spokesperson said.

“Google is the largest search engine in America and has an obligation to consumers to utilize fair business practice,” the spokesperson added. “We will be subpoenaing information on Google’s algorithms and other systems to determine whether they are censoring conservative speech.”

Bailey accused Google of “waging war on the democratic process” in an X post announcing the probe on Thursday.

“I am launching an investigation into Google — the biggest search engine in America — for censoring conservative speech during the most consequential election in our nation’s history,” Bailey wrote.

A Google spokesperson said the Missouri attorney general’s “claims are totally false.”

“Independent studies have confirmed that Google Search is nonpartisan,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Search serves all our users, and our business rests on showing useful information to everyone — no matter what their political beliefs are.”

Trump and other Republicans have alleged for years that Google suppresses conservative voices. Scrutiny ramped up after the “autofill” feature of Google’s search engine appeared to omit results related to the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13.

In August, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee demanded information from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg regarding whether their platforms had suppressed information about the incident.

The panel also sought information about the inner workings of Google’s search algorithm.

Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) asked Pichai to provide details on how the search tool’s autocomplete feature incorporates newsworthy events and whether it tries to “avoid query results that Google desires to limit or preclude because it views them to be harmful or dangerous.”

Google denied wrongdoing and said information about the Trump assassination attempt did not initially appear because of “built-in protections related to political violence” that were out of date.

Trump directly accused Google of bias in a Sept. 27 post on Truth Social — and indicated he would seek to prosecute the company if he takes office.

Trump posted one day after the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog, published an analysis asserting that search results for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign website were placed in more prominent location than the official site for Trump.

The group also claimed that Google placed articles with a “leftist bias” atop search results for Trump.

“It has been determined that Google has illegally used a system of only revealing and displaying bad stories about Donald J. Trump, some made up for this purpose while, at the same time, only revealing good stories about Comrade Kamala Harris,” Trump wrote at the time.

“This is an illegal activity, and hopefully the Justice Department will criminally prosecute them for this blatant interference of elections,” Trump said. “If not, and subject to the laws of our country, I will request their prosecution, at the maximum levels, when I win the election, and become president of the United States.”",GOOGL,yes,fmp,733

Alphabet had previously announced in July that it was pledging another $5 billion to Waymo, but was mum on the specifics, saying only that it was a “multi-year” commitment. Andreesen Horowitz, Silver Lake, Fidelity, Tiger Global, Perry Creek, and T. Rowe Price all joined the round. Waymo declined to say how much each invested.

It’s Waymo’s second external fundraising round, and its first since a $2.25 billion Series B in 2020 that eventually grew to $3.2 billion. The autonomous vehicle company says it will use the funds to expand into new cities and further develop its autonomous capabilities for “business applications.”

Waymo is in some ways a much different company now than it was when it raised that last round. At that time, the company was still plowing headlong into an autonomous trucking effort that it has since pulled back from.

The company has instead put nearly its entire focus on its robotaxi ride-hailing service. The bet has paid off. Waymo now operates commercial robotaxi services in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and is expanding to Austin and Atlanta.

The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

In a statement to CNBC, Waymo co-CEOs Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov said the funding would go toward expansion and advancing the Waymo Driver for business applications.

""With this latest investment, we will continue to welcome more riders into our Waymo One ride-hailing service in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, and in Austin and Atlanta through our expanded partnership with Uber,"" they wrote.

The series C funding brings Waymo's total capital raised to more than $11 billion after it raised $3.2 billion and $2.5 billion in two earlier rounds. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat announced in July that the parent company would commit to a multiyear investment of up to $5 billion in Waymo.

While many companies are testing autonomous vehicles, or AVs, on public roads in the U.S., including well-funded upstarts such as Wayve, Waymo is the only one to operate a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas.

The service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. And it has even been used by parents to send their teens to school when other transit options felt less safe or convenient.

Waymo now conducts more than 100,000 weekly trips for passengers in Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco, who can hail their robotaxis via the Waymo One app. More recently, Waymo partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas — home of would-be rival Tesla's headquarters.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made promises about self-driving cars for more than a decade. This week, he said Tesla would offer a driverless ride-hailing service in Texas and California next year, once the company upgrades the partially automated systems in its existing vehicles, which still require a human driver today.

GM-owned Cruise had been Waymo's closest competitor in the U.S. until it paused operations following an October 2023 incident in San Francisco in which a pedestrian was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise AV, after she was first struck by a human driver in another car. Cruise is working to reinstate its service and also plans to partner with Uber.

Self-driving vehicle makers in the U.S. must still prove their technology is safer to use than taxis and trucks with human drivers. As CNBC previously reported, nearly two-thirds of U.S. respondents to a Pew Research Center survey said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity.

Waymo's self-reported data suggests that their vehicles crash ""far less often than human drivers on public roads,"" according to analysis by Understanding AI author Timothy B. Lee.

Still, Waymo has initiated software recalls to improve the safety of its self-driving systems, and its AVs have sometimes blocked traffic, traveled the wrong way down the street, or been involved in collisions, though none resulted in a known fatality or severe injury.

The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that's equipped with its custom sensors and AI ""Driver."" Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker's Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

In August, Waymo said it would also test its driverless vehicles in harsher, winter weather including in northern California, upstate New York and Michigan, with the hope of offering robotaxi services beyond the sunbelt, and eventually internationally.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,793

Civil society groups implored Google on Thursday to rigorously enforce its policy to demonetize environmental disinformation, saying ads placed alongside climate denial content persistently popped up despite the tech titan's pledge to crack down.

The open letter, addressed to Google chief Sundar Pichai and endorsed by thousands of signatories, comes in the wake of major hurricanes in the United States sparking an avalanche of disinformation and just weeks before the UN COP29 climate summit.

In 2021, Google announced a policy prohibiting ads alongside content that denied the existence and causes of climate change, seeking to ensure disinformation peddlers cannot monetize its influential platforms, including YouTube.

But the letter from a dozen groups, including the Union of Concerned Scientists and tech watchdog Center for Countering Digital Hate, said the ads have not stopped.

""We are urging Google to enforce the policy thoroughly and immediately to ensure it is credible, as we see climate change adversely affecting communities right now,"" the letter said.

While Google has demonetized some content by the Heartland Institute, a conservative US think tank, watchdogs have continued to find ads alongside its misleading climate messaging on YouTube, the letter said.

It urged Google to ""immediately and permanently demonetize Heartland Institute"" as well as other outlets that spread climate disinformation.

Nonprofit watchdog Check My Ads, which also signed the letter, said in a report last month that ad exchanges helped three conservative websites, including The Epoch Times, to profit from climate denialism.

Last month, another investigation by the campaign group Global Witness estimated that The Epoch Times generated around $1.5 million in combined revenue for Google and the website owners over the past year.

YouTube has also allowed the monetization of climate denial content peddled by influencers on the payroll of a Russian influence campaign, the environmental group Friends of the Earth said in a report last month.

""Google ads are directly contributing to the spread of outright lies about our planet's changing climate –- with dire impacts,"" the letter said.

Google did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment.

The groups behind the letter said they have requested a meeting with Google's trust and safety team to discuss the violations of its demonetization policy and were waiting to hear back.

The letter follows destructive hurricanes that slammed the United States in recent weeks, triggering a torrent of misinformation that officials said hampered relief efforts.

2024-10-25 03:30:00,"1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Soars 200%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/25/1-ai-stock-to-buy-before-it-soars-200-wall-street/,"Trefis analysts think Alphabet could be a $500 stock by the end of the decade.

Trefis analysts think Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%) could be a $500 stock by 2030. That forecast comes from an opinion piece published in Forbes in October, and it implies a little over 200% upside from the current share price of $162. Should it prove accurate, shareholders would see annual returns of approximately 20% over the next six-plus years.

Wall Street also expects Alphabet to move higher in the near-term. Of the 68 analysts that follow the company, the lowest 12-month price target of $170 per share implies 5% upside. In other words, not one analyst thinks the stock will decline over the next 12 months. Of course, there is no such thing as a guarantee where the stock market is concerned, but the optimism is nevertheless noteworthy.

Here's what investors should know about Alphabet, and what it might take for its share price to hit $500 by 2030.

Alphabet should benefit as the digital advertising and cloud computing markets expand

The investment thesis for Alphabet hinges on its strength in advertising and cloud computing, two markets projected to grow quickly. Specifically, eMarketer expects digital ad spending to increase at 10% annually through 2028, and IDC estimates public cloud spending will grow at 19% annually during the same period, led by high demand in artificial intelligence (AI) platform services.

Alphabet is the market leader in digital advertising with 27.4% revenue share. That figure is forecast to decline by half-percentage point next year as Amazon and other competitors gain ground. But Alphabet has a material advantage in that it owns six products with over 2 billion monthly users, including Google Search and YouTube. Those popular platforms engage consumers and create data that supports ad targeting.

Importantly, Alphabet is leaning on its AI expertise to defend its leadership in digital advertising. CEO Sundar Pichai says generative AI overviews on Google Search are boosting usage and improving user satisfaction, especially among people aged 18 to 24. The company also debuted over 30 new AI features for its ad tech software last quarter to streamline workflows and improve campaign outcomes.

Finally, Alphabet operates the third-largest public cloud in Google Cloud Platform. While the company trails Amazon and Microsoft by a wide margin, strength in AI infrastructure and large language models helped it gain a percentage point of market share over the past year. ""Google's Gemini combines a world-class model with enterprise cloud services,"" according to Forrester Research.

Alphabet has an overlooked opportunity in its autonomous ride-hailing business Waymo

Trefis analysts highlighted autonomous driving subsidiary Waymo as a major reason why Alphabet could be a $500 stock by 2030. Investors often overlook that part of the business, but the robotaxi market is expected to increase at 67% annually through 2030, according to Straits Research. And Alphabet is well positioned to be a major winner.

Waymo was the first company to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service, and it now provides more than 100,000 rides per week across Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. To add, Waymo has partnered with Uber to bring its ride-hailing platform to Atlanta and Austin in 2025. Analysts at Bank of America estimate Waymo's revenue could reach $75 million this year, an inconsequential sum, but that figure could grow rapidly in the future.

Anecdotally, I recently visited San Francisco and had the chance to use the Waymo app. The experience was seamless and the technology was impressive. The Waymo vehicle was appropriately cautious as it navigated the congested city streets lined with pedestrians, but it was also assertive when necessary. I have never been more certain that robotaxis are the future.

What it would take for Alphabet to be a $500 stock by 2030

Investors should be aware of the regulatory risk. A federal judge ruled in August that Google had engaged in illegal practices to preserve its search monopoly. The Justice Department has suggested remedies ranging from restrictions to a breakup. But the judge will not issue a final decision until August 2025, and appeals could drag the process out for years.

Importantly, while the Justice Department has proposed a forced divestiture of the Chrome browser or Android operating system, some legal experts believe the final solution will be less severe. They say the most likely outcome is that Alphabet will be prohibited from paying companies like Apple for default search engine placement, according to CNBC.

With that in mind, Wall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase at 15.6% annually through 2027, which makes the current valuation of 23 times earnings look reasonable. If we assume the company's earnings increase at the same pace through 2030, Alphabet's share price would reach $500 if the stock traded at 30.7 times earnings. That would be a material premium to its current valuation, which seems unlikely six-plus years down the road.

Having said that, Alphabet's earnings could grow more quickly than analysts anticipate if Waymo becomes a meaningful source of profit. In that context, a $500 share price is not out of the question. Either way, patient investors should feel confident about buying a small position in this stock today.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,1089

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Britain's competition watchdog said Thursday it's opening a formal investigation into Google's partnership with artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.

The Competition and Markets Authority said it has ""sufficient information"" to launch an initial probe after it sought input earlier this year on whether the deal would stifle competition.

The CMA has until Dec. 19 to decide whether to approve the deal or escalate its investigation.

""Google is committed to building the most open and innovative AI ecosystem in the world,"" the company said. ""Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and does, and we don't demand exclusive tech rights.""

San Francisco-based Anthropic was founded in 2021 by siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, who previously worked at ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The company has focused on increasing the safety and reliability of AI models. Google reportedly agreed last year to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic, which has a popular chatbot named Claude.

Anthropic said it's cooperating with the regulator and will provide ""the complete picture about Google's investment and our commercial collaboration.""

""We are an independent company and none of our strategic partnerships or investor relationships diminish the independence of our corporate governance or our freedom to partner with others,"" it said in a statement.

The U.K. regulator has been scrutinizing a raft of AI deals as investment money floods into the industry to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. Last month it cleared Anthropic's $4 billion deal with Amazon and it has also signed off on Microsoft's deals with two other AI startups, Inflection and Mistral.

2024-10-24 16:06:15,UK's CMA Launches Antitrust Probe Into Alphabet's $2 Billion Partnership With Anthropic,https://www.pymnts.com/antitrust/2024/united-kingdom-cma-launches-antitrust-probe-into-alphabet-2-billion-dollar-partnership-with-anthropic/,"The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is in charge of antitrust regulation, is investigating a partnership between tech giant Alphabet and artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.

It will launch a probe Friday (Oct. 25) that aims to determine whether the deal could undermine competition in the United Kingdom, according to a notice issued Thursday (Oct. 24). The investigation began with a review July 30, and the CMA invited anyone interested to comment until Aug. 13.

The investigation stems from Alphabet-owned Google’s financial backing of Anthropic, including a $500 million investment last year and an additional commitment of $1.5 billion ($2 billion total), Reuters reported Thursday.

The investment signified Alphabet’s interest in strengthening its position in the AI landscape. Rival Microsoft supports OpenAI, which released ChatGPT in 2022, for example.

Anthropic, which was co-founded by former OpenAI executives Dario Amodei and Daniela Amodei, uses Google Cloud services for its operations, Reuters reported.

“Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and does, we don’t demand exclusive tech rights,” an Alphabet spokesperson said, according to the report, adding that Alphabet is dedicated to maintaining an open and innovative AI ecosystem.

The probe launch is the first phase of the CMA’s investigation, per the Thursday notice. The regulator’s deadline to announce its decision is Dec. 19. At that time, it will determine if a more in-depth investigation is necessary.

An Anthropic spokesperson told Reuters that the company will cooperate with the investigation, per the report.

“We are an independent company, and none of our strategic partnerships or investor relationships diminish the independence of our corporate governance or our freedom to partner with others,” the spokesperson said, according to the report.

The CMA cleared a similar $4 billion partnership between Anthropic and Amazon without requiring a full-scale investigation, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.

In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice began antitrust investigations in June into Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia. The probes will scrutinize these companies’ roles in the AI industry, focusing on their business practices rather than mergers and acquisitions.

However, the company's stock took a hit the day after the report amid concerns about the tech giant's higher spending on artificial intelligence (AI).

CEO Sundar Pichai told investors in the company’s earnings call in July that when it comes to spending on AI, ""the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.""

Jefferies analysts called AI an ""emerging contributor"" for Google Cloud, and said that while they expect continued growth in the third quarter, the benefits from AI could become more pronounced in 2025 and 2026. The Visible Alpha analyst consensus for Google Cloud revenue in the third quarter is $10.87 billion, which would represent 29% growth.

Anat Ashkenazi took over as Alphabet’s chief financial officer on July 31, which could open the door for new disclosures after the former Eli Lilly (LLY) executive’s first quarter on the job, Bank of America analysts said.

Some potential third-quarter positives the new CFO could address include Google Search strength suggesting that AI is driving higher monetization, YouTube benefit from political spending, and new advertising opportunities, the analysts said.

2024-10-24 10:23:50,UK competition regulator to investigate Alphabet's investment in Anthropic,https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/uk-competition-regulator-to-investigate-alphabets-investment-in-anthropic/,"The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is launching a formal probe into Alphabet’s investment in AI rival Anthropic.

The investigation comes three months after the CMA confirmed it was inviting “interested parties” to comment on Alphabet’s various investments in Anthropic, which includes a reported $300 million early last year followed by another reported $2 billion.

The probe being launched now is part of a multi-pronged investigation designed to tackle the so-called quasi-merger, which has seen Big Tech firms take a fresh approach to gaining control of innovative young startups by, for example, hiring startup founders and technical talent, as well as making strategic investments.

Beyond Alphabet’s own investments in Anthropic, the 3-year-old San Francisco startup has been courting other big-name investors, including Amazon, which has invested $4 billion in the startup. The CMA had been sniffing around that partnership, too, but last month it concluded that it couldn’t investigate the deal under current merger rules due to the size and scope of the deal.

The fact that the CMA has decided that Alphabet’s investment in the same startup does qualify as a “relevant merger situation” is telling. It suggests that the terms of Alphabet’s investment in Anthropic are different from those of Amazon’s, or that Alphabet’s deal will harm competition in a way that the Amazon partnership wouldn’t.

In a statement issued to TechCrunch, a spokesperson for Alphabet subsidiary Google said that “Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and does, and we don’t demand exclusive tech rights.”

The CMA, meanwhile, said it has “sufficient information” regarding the partnership to begin an investigation before deciding whether to refer the case to a more in-depth “phase 2” investigation. This decision is expected by December 19, 2024.

An Anthropic spokesperson said that it intends to cooperate with the CMA.

“We are an independent company and none of our strategic partnerships or investor relationships diminish the independence of our corporate governance or our freedom to partner with others,” they said. “Anthropic’s independence is a core attribute — integral both to our public benefit mission and to serving our customers wherever and however they prefer to access Claude.”",GOOGL,yes,fmp,449

Revenues are expected to be $72.83 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Over the last 30 days, there has been an upward revision of 0.3% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.

Ahead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.

While investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.

Bearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Alphabet metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.

Analysts expect 'Revenues- Google properties' to come in at $57.74 billion. The estimate points to a change of +11.1% from the year-ago quarter.

The consensus estimate for 'Revenues- Google Cloud' stands at $10.91 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +29.7% from the prior-year quarter.

The combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenues- YouTube ads' will likely reach $8.86 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +11.4% year over year.

According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenues- Google advertising' should come in at $65.22 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +9.4%.

Analysts' assessment points toward 'Revenues- Google Search & other' reaching $48.84 billion. The estimate points to a change of +10.9% from the year-ago quarter.

Based on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenues- Google Network' should arrive at $7.43 billion. The estimate points to a change of -3.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Analysts forecast 'Revenues- EMEA' to reach $24.42 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.8%.

It is projected by analysts that the 'Revenues- United States' will reach $40.21 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +10.6% year over year.

The average prediction of analysts places 'Revenues- Other Americas (Canada and Latin America)' at $7.45 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +63.6%.

Analysts predict that the 'Revenues- APAC' will reach $14.06 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7.1% from the prior-year quarter.

The consensus among analysts is that 'Total TAC (traffic acquisition costs)' will reach $13.41 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $12.64 billion in the same quarter last year.

The collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Headcount (Number of employees)' of 180,974. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 182,381 in the same quarter of the previous year.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Perplexity AI chief Aravind Srinivas said Wednesday that he hopes to collaborate with news publishers which accuse the Google challenger of freeloading off their work.

Srinivas took part in an on-stage interview at a Wall Street Journal tech conference in California just days after the news outlet and the New York Post filed a lawsuit arguing that Perplexity is guilty of massive copyright infringement and trademark violations.

""We certainly were very surprised about the lawsuit, because we actually wanted a conversation,"" Srinivas said.

""I'm here to make it very clear that I would love to have a commercial contract.""

Srinivas criticized Google's model of directing traffic to websites, raking in money along the way from ads or sponsored results.

He laid out a vision of Perplexity artificial intelligence insightfully answering online queries, then sharing ad revenue with sources cited by the search engine in process.

""We're going to do advertising on Perplexity,"" Srinivas said.

""Whenever we make advertising revenue, we're going to share that revenue with the content publishers in a manner inspired by Spotify.""

Perplexity.ai is a question-answering platform known for its minimalist and conversational interface.

Unlike ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, Perplexity's tool provides up-to-date answers that often include links to source materials, allowing users to verify information.

And unlike a classic search engine, Perplexity provides ready-made answers on its webpage, making it unnecessary for users to click through to the source website.

Srinivas said he aims for money-losing Perplexity to become profitable in three to five years.

""I would rather figure out a model where we can grow together, where our financial success rewards you than try to just solve my problem by licensing content and moving on,"" Srinivas told the Journal interviewer.

A lawsuit filed Monday accuses Perplexity of ""massive freeriding"" on protected content that allowed the company to divert readers and revenue from the Wall Street Journal and New York Post.

""I'm hopeful that we can figure something out here,"" Srinivas said.

Similar allegations have been made by The New York Times, which has sent a cease and desist letter to Perplexity.

Launched at the end of 2022, Perplexity handled about 350 million queries in September as use accelerated from the 500 million queries at the search engine during all of last year, according to its chief and co-founder.

At that rate, Perplexity could be handling a half-billion search queries daily by 2026, he reasoned.

""A product like ours can only succeed if there is a flourishing ecosystem of good journalism,"" Srinivas said.

""I don't think just licensing content is the solution.""

2024-10-24 09:00:00,How Much Does Google Make in Ad Revenue?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/24/how-much-does-google-make-in-ad-revenue/,"Alphabet dominates the digital ad market. Take a look at the numbers.

Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%) is the world's biggest advertising company. It established itself as the industry leader largely due to the strength of Google Search, which has a monopoly-like market share for online search. That business, more than any other under Alphabet's umbrella, has helped give the company a valuation of around $2 trillion.

Digital advertising has proven to be a highly lucrative business for Alphabet, and it's driven superior operating margins at the company for much of its history. After all, Google's search page is among the most valuable digital real estate properties on the internet. It's the first place most users go when they want to get new information about a health concern, a trip they're planning, or a restaurant they're interested in, among other things.

The chart below shows how Google compares to its closest rivals in search around the world.

As you can see, not only is Alphabet light years ahead of Microsoft, Baidu, and Yandex, but there's more to Alphabet's ad business than just search. So where does Alphabet's ad revenue come from?

Of the $237.9 billion Alphabet generated in ad revenue in 2023, $175.0 billion, or 73.6%, came from Google Search. The company's trademark search engine remains the primary driver of both revenue and profits at the tech giant.

After Search, it brought in $31.5 billion, or 13.3%, via YouTube, its leading video-sharing platform. Google Network, its third-party ads that are served on partner websites, brought in $31.3 billion, about the same percentage as YouTube.

Google's ad business is still delivering strong growth, up 11% year over year in the second quarter. And based on its dominance of the space and the consistent need of businesses to advertise on Google, it's likely to continue to grow.

The collaborations are part of the race to build the next artificial intelligence application. The rise of generative AI — tech that can produce human-like responses when prompted — has companies from Apple to Honeywell rushing to tap its capabilities. ""Google will also come to China to ask us, what needs and pain points do you have with your products? Let's solve them together,"" Billy Zhang, president of Oppo's overseas market, sales and services, told reporters last week at the company's office in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. ""We know consumers' needs, and we will use AI to satisfy [them],"" Zhang said. The company is expanding further in Europe, but does not have immediate plans for the U.S., he said. Oppo, which owns the OnePlus brand too, said around 60% of its shipments come from Southeast Asia, Europe and other overseas markets. The company ranked fourth globally in terms of smartphone shipments in the third quarter, making up 9% of all units shipped, according to Canalys. Samsung and Apple were tied for the first spot, followed by Xiaomi .

While the U.S. leads in terms of AI capabilities, experts suggest Chinese companies will have an edge when it comes to consumer applications of the tech. That's despite U.S. restrictions on exports of high-end chips to China. Oppo has said the global version of its forthcoming flagship smartphone will be equipped with AI writing and recording summary tools from Google's Gemini, and text-to-speech features from Microsoft. Microsoft employs OpenAI products such as ChatGPT. It was not immediately clear to what extent existing Oppo models use AI tools from the two tech companies. Oppo announced Thursday its new flagship Find X8 series is ""coming soon"" to global markets. But the company has yet to specify when.

Oppo in June announced it plans to integrate generative AI in 50 million of its devices this year. Its existing AI tools allow touching up photos — such as removing window reflections. Oppo also has a ChatGPT-like bot. In addition to partnerships, Oppo said it has developed its own AI models since 2020 and opened an AI center in February. ""We are very optimistic about AI and have invested with great determination,"" Zhang said. ""AI is the most important area for tech in the future. All industries can be transformed by AI."" Counterpoint Research predicts shipments of generative AI smartphones will skyrocket to 732 million in 2028 from 46 million last year, according to a whitepaper published Wednesday. The report did not specify how complex those generative AI features would be. Apple next week is due to publicly release its first software update with AI tools. A subsequent update will allow removing unwanted elements in photos, and integration with ChatGPT, the iPhone maker said Wednesday. Chinese smartphone company Honor on Wednesday revealed the next version of its operating system that can use AI to mimic actions on a touchscreen, such as opening an app to order coffee delivery.

Oppo plans to integrate AI into its factories, which are increasingly automated, Zhang said. ""Today, automation improves quality and stability, lowers production costs and increases unit yield."" At a production line for an entry-level smartphone in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, Oppo has this year replaced about 8% of the workers with machines, and moved those employees to work on more complex, higher-end phones. Other companies have announced plans to integrate generative AI with the industrial sector. Honeywell this week announced a deal with Google's Gemini to create AI assistants for factory workers and systems. Oppo is rolling out its digital management system to its factories in seven other countries, starting with India and Indonesia. The company also produces phones in Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil and Egypt. ""Since our manufacturing process is largely digitalized and standardized, growing and expanding to global markets is much easier,"" Danny Du, director of manufacturing management at Oppo told CNBC. Oppo has cut its manufacturing costs by nearly 40% over three years, Du said, adding that technological integration with factory machines and systems has cut production time to six days, from 16. He said that allows Oppo to respond more quickly to market orders, instead of relying on longer-term forecasts that come with the risk of unsold inventory. — CNBC's Kif Leswing and Eric Rosenbaum contributed to this report.

Those at Mizuho Financial took the lead last quarter when boosting their valuations for PayPal stock up to $90 a share. Still, after a sharp rally to get there in record time, new valuations have been placed on the company. This time, Mizuho wants to see PayPal at $100 a share and reiterated an Outperform rating on the company as well.

Calling for a further 23.6% upside from where the stock trades today, not to mention a new 52-week high, is a bold prediction, though one that other Wall Street participants are accepting. Institutional buying is a gauge investors can consider when contemplating whether analysts are being too bullish or bearish on a stock.

Today, those at International Assets Investment Management have boosted their PayPal stock holdings by 9,864% as of October 2024. This massive jump in allocation would bring their investment to $84.3 million as a sign of confidence in PayPal for the coming quarter.

Confidence can be justified further by today’s Wall Street earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for PayPal, which shoot for $1.30 a share in 12 months. This implies a growth rate of 9.2% from today’s $1.19 level.

After a more than 12% sell-off in Google's parent company, Alphabet, investors forgot how vital this company is to the global economy and how likely it was to pose a recovery rally shortly thereafter. As it turns out, Alphabet recovered half of the lost gains in only two weeks, returning to 83% of its 52-week high, but Wall Street analysts think there’s more to be had.

Those at Truist Financial reiterated their Buy rating on Alphabet stock as of October 2024, boosting their valuations up to $220 a share from their previous $196 a share. To prove these new targets right, Alphabet would have to rally by as much as 34.2% from where it trades today, also calling for a new year-high.

The same firm that bought a new massive stake in PayPal also landed on Alphabet recently; International Assets Investment Management saw it fit to add up to 43,000% to their Alphabet stock stakes, bringing their net allocation up to $31.1 billion today. Taking such a sizeable position in the company sends a message investors should not ignore in today’s market.

One significant tailwind helping Alphabet harness momentum from investors is that its self-driving rideshare initiative, through Waymo, has started to outperform even the most optimistic expectations. If this project takes off in favor of Alphabet, it will return the investments made into it in spades for shareholders.

After a disappointing quarterly earnings release, shares of ASML dropped by as much as 16% in a single day, though today’s prices might not remain there for long. Investors can dismiss the previous bearish momentum mainly because the stock’s valuation multiplies.

Particularly the forward P/E ratio, which is now right at the pre-COVID average of 27.5x. Risk-wise, this means that any and all slowdown risks from the pandemic demand cycles might already be priced through this valuation. Knowing that the risk-to-reward ratios favor a buy, Wall Street analysts kept an optimistic outlook.

Those at J.P. Morgan Chase reiterated an Overweight rating for ASML stock, keeping a price target of up to $1,148 a share for a net upside of as much as 61.8% from where the stock trades today to pose a swift recovery. Again, the same institutional buyer made its way into ASML.

International Assets Investment Management raised its stake in ASML stock by a staggering 94,079% as of October 2024, bringing its net position to $4.1 billion today. This is another sign for investors to consider when considering a purchase in this stock with room to catch up.

2024-10-24 04:20:00,A Once-in-a-Decade Investment Opportunity: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/24/once-in-decade-invest-opportunity-2-ai-stocks-buy/,"These two players look pretty cheap...

Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks offer a compelling investment theme because we're at the beginning of what could be a game-changing story. It can potentially change how we manage our daily tasks, make companies more efficient, and lead to major discoveries in areas like healthcare. JPMorgan Chase chief executive officer Jamie Dimon has even likened AI to transformations such as the printing press and electricity.

This means getting in on certain high-potential AI companies today -- when their shares are reasonably priced -- could represent a once-in-a-decade investment opportunity. The AI market is forecast to grow from $200 billion today to potentially $1 trillion by 2030, and these companies' stock prices may take off as more and more investors recognize the earnings potential. As a result, the stocks could become much more expensive than they are today.

That's why now represents the perfect moment to shop around for solid AI players, and these two should be at the top of your buy list.

Alphabet (GOOG 1.50%) (GOOGL 1.57%) is probably best known for its crown jewel, Google Search. The search engine is the world's No. 1, holding more than 90% share, and that has equaled a revenue powerhouse for Alphabet. Advertisers flock to the platform to reach Google Search users, generating billions of dollars in revenue for the company.

Over the past few years, Alphabet has plunged into the world of AI, using the technology to improve Google Search and selling its AI tools to customers of Google Cloud, its cloud computing business. So, AI may help Alphabet attract more advertising dollars if Google Search becomes even stronger and we spend more time using it...and AI is already generating revenue for Alphabet through the cloud business.

In fact, Alphabet said during its latest earnings report that its AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions already brought in billions of dollars in revenue this year. The cloud business showed double-digit growth in revenue and triple-digit growth in operating profit in the quarter, with those figures reaching the milestones of $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively.

Meanwhile, shares of Alphabet remain reasonably priced, trading at 21x forward earnings estimates, offering you a terrific opportunity to get in early on this potentially explosive AI growth story.

Meta Platforms (META 0.96%) chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has been very straightforward about his AI ambitions. His goal is to make Meta an AI leader and he's poured investment dollars into developing large language models, training them, and using them to fuel products like AI assistants. Zuckerberg says he hopes one day Meta will offer users assistants for all their needs, from leisure to professional.

We may expect other AI-based products and services from Meta, considering the company's commitment to exploring the technology. Meta has made AI its biggest investment area of this year, with the company bringing on board 600,000 graphics processing units. The tech giant is one of the main customers of top chip designer, Nvidia, and also has developed its own chips as it goes all in on this technology.

It's also important to remember that as Meta invests in this high-growth area, the company continues to generate billions of dollars in earnings thanks to its ownership of Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Like Alphabet, it makes most of its revenue through advertising, and also like Alphabet, if AI helps improve its product -- in this case social media apps -- advertising revenue could climb.

Today, Meta shares trade for 27x forward earnings estimates, which looks like an absolute steal considering the company's position in the high-growth area of AI as well as its solid earnings track record and financial position -- this year Meta even started paying a dividend, showing it can afford to fund growth and reward shareholders. And all of this means that now may represent a valuable opportunity to get in on this top AI story.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,786

2024-10-23 11:38:14,Google releases tech to watermark AI-generated text,https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/google-releases-tech-to-watermark-ai-generated-text/,"Google is making SynthID Text, its technology that lets developers watermark and detect text written by generative AI models, generally available.

SynthID Text can be downloaded from the AI platform Hugging Face and Google’s updated Responsible GenAI Toolkit.

“We’re open-sourcing our SynthID Text watermarking tool,” the company wrote in a post on X. “Available freely to developers and businesses, it will help them identify their AI-generated content.”

So how does SynthID Text work, exactly?

Given a prompt like “What’s your favorite fruit?,” text-generating models predict which “token” most likely follows another — one token at a time. Tokens, which can be a single character or word, are the building blocks a generative model uses to process information. A model assigns each possible token a score, which is the percentage chance it’s included in the output text. SynthID Text inserts additional info in this token distribution by “modulating the likelihood of tokens being generated,” Google says.

“The final pattern of scores for both the model’s word choices combined with the adjusted probability scores are considered the watermark,” the company wrote in a blog post. “This pattern of scores is compared with the expected pattern of scores for watermarked and unwatermarked text, helping SynthID detect if an AI tool generated the text or if it might come from other sources.”

Google claims that SynthID Text, which has been integrated with its Gemini models since this spring, doesn’t compromise the quality, accuracy, or speed of text generation, and works even on text that’s been cropped, paraphrased, or modified.

But the company also admits that its watermarking approach has limitations.

For example, SynthID Text doesn’t perform as well with short text, with text that’s been rewritten or translated from another language, or with responses to factual questions. “On responses to factual prompts, there are fewer opportunities to adjust the token distribution without affecting the factual accuracy,” explains the company. “This includes prompts like ‘What is the capital of France?,’ or queries where little or no variation is expected, like ‘recite a William Wordsworth poem.’”

Google isn’t the only company working on AI text watermarking tech. OpenAI has for years researched watermarking methods, but delayed their release over technical and commercial considerations.

Watermarking techniques for text, if widely adopted, could help turn the tide on inaccurate — but increasingly popular — “AI detectors” that falsely flag essays and papers written in a more generic voice. But the question is, will they be widely adopted — and will one organization’s proposed standard or tech win out over others?

There may soon be legal mechanisms that force developers’ hands. China’s government has introduced mandatory watermarking of AI-generated content, and the state of California is looking to do the same.

There’s urgency to the situation. According to a report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency, 90% of online content could be synthetically generated by 2026, leading to new law enforcement challenges around disinformation, propaganda, fraud, and deception. Already, nearly 60% of all sentences on the web may be AI-generated, per an AWS study — thanks to the widespread use of AI translators.

2024-10-23 11:08:46,"Wiz hopes to hit $1B in ARR in 2025 before an IPO, after turning down Google's $23B",https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/wiz-hopes-to-hit-1b-in-arr-in-2025-before-an-ipo-after-turning-down-googles-23b/,"Wiz co-founder and VP of R&D Roy Reznik told CNBC last week that the company has hit $500 million in annual recurring revenue, and plans to double that in 2025 to $1 billion. He also reiterated that the $1 billion-mark is a prerequisite for the IPO that Wiz promised employees when it walked away from acquisition talks with Google last summer at a $23 billion price tag.

ARR at the cloud security startup was at about $350 million in May, but was already around $500 million by July when it walked from Google, TechCrunch reported at the time. In an email to employees after deal talks ended, Wiz’s CEO Assaf Rappaport told Wiz’s 1,200 employees that the company wanted $1 billion in ARR before an IPO. Back then, Wiz execs expected to hit the number in 2025. So to have Reznik double down last week is a good sign that Wiz is still growing as expected. A spokesperson also confirmed this ARR goal to TechCrunch.

Wiz was already experiencing fast growth, practically since its inception. In 2022, Wiz claimed to be the fastest startup to $100 million ARR ever, reaching that goal just 18 months after it launched in 2020.

Google’s offer also came right when Wiz was in a perfect position to weather turning it down. It had just raised $1 billion a few months earlier, in May, at a $12 billion valuation, led by Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Thrive Capital. Wiz called itself the world’s largest cyber unicorn at the time.

“We’ve already broken a few records as a private company, and we believe we can also break a few more records as an independent public company as well,” Reznik told CNBC last week, as he announced expansion in the U.K. with a London office. Reznik talked about the growth rate of cloud computing, and how global spending on cloud security is already at over $30 billion this year. His implication was that Wiz still has a lot of room to grow.

Should Wiz achieve the $1 billion ARR number before attempting an IPO — and if its underlying financials are strong and indicate more potential growth — it could indeed have a record-breaking public debut. Back in 2020 Snowflake broke records for its IPO as the biggest software IPO ever, when shares closed the day at a $70 billion market cap. This was on fast-growing revenues of $265 million and a net loss of $348 million. Snowflake investors haven’t maintained that exuberance, but the company is still trading at around a $39 billion market cap.

In other words, Wiz still has reason to believe that it could indeed look back at a $23 billion offer in 2024 and sneeze.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,581
2024-10-23 10:35:57,Is Alphabet (GOOGL) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2355717/is-alphabet-googl-a-buy-as-wall-street-analysts-look-optimistic?cid=CS-STOCKNEWSAPI-FT-fundamental_analysis|average_broker_rating-2355717,"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?

Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet ( Free Report) .

Alphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.40, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 47 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.40 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the 47 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.6% and 6.4% of all recommendations.





Check price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>



While the ABR calls for buying Alphabet, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.

Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.

In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.

Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.

ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank

Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.

The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.

Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.

On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.

There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.

In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Alphabet, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $7.65.

Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.

The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Alphabet. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

2024-10-23 05:57:58,Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/23/alphabet-to-7-trillion-by-2025/,"We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin. And this growth will be driven by its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business as it quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This growing adoption would take Alphabet stock to over $500 a share - putting it on a growth trajectory that could dwarf what Nvidia has seen over recent years (Buy, Sell, Or Hold Nvidia Stock).

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies

Returns for Google stock were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, and 59% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,1186
2024-10-23 05:20:00,3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $500 and Hold for Decades,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/23/3-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to-buy-with-50/,"It's not about today's AI winners, but the companies pushing AI forward over the next 10, 20, or 30 years.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is new and full of exciting potential. But just like the internet, AI will evolve, so it's hard to say what the future will look like. So, how does someone invest in AI for the long term? Not for next year, but for decades out?

If it were me, I would look beyond specific AI applications and instead focus on what will drive AI's evolution. At its core, AI needs three things: chips, cloud, and data. These are what power, train, and distribute AI technology to the world. So, you want to invest in AI? Look for the companies leading in these three areas.

In that lens, three AI stocks instantly jumped out: Arm Holdings (ARM 1.92%), Amazon (AMZN 0.78%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1.50%) (GOOGL 1.57%).

Buy them all for roughly $500 today and hold them for decades to profit from AI, a story still in its early chapters. Here is the pitch for each stock:

Everything ""smart"" runs on CPUs, so pick up the ultimate picks-and-shovels AI chip stock

Nvidia has received considerable attention since its GPU chips are used to train AI models, but I think Arm Holdings might have better long-term positioning. Most of the AI innovation you see today is contained within data centers, where powerful AI models like ChatGPT are trained. But over time, AI technology could spread across everyday life. Vehicles may drive themselves, and your glasses might have as many capabilities as your smartphone -- who knows what else will be possible.

Anything AI touches must have a computer, which is where Arm comes in. Arm designs architecture for central processing units (CPUs), chips that effectively act as a computer's brain. The company earns royalties and fees for every chip built using its proprietary designs.

That's a big deal because Arm is dominant. Virtually every smartphone on Earth uses Arm-based chips, and the company is picking up market share across almost every notable technology end market.

According to Statista, Arm's market share increased from 42% to 49% from 2020 to 2022. This strong momentum seemingly bodes well for the company's future as the broader need for chips grows over the coming decades. It's hard not to like Arm if you're an AI investor thinking years ahead.

AI will run through the cloud, making Amazon an AI must-have

The cloud isn't in the sky; it's in data centers. Companies like Amazon build massive centralized computing systems and then rent out capacity. It's cheaper for companies to purchase cloud computing power than to build and maintain their own systems. Amazon started as an e-commerce company, but it has built Amazon Web Services (AWS) into the world's leading cloud platform with an estimated 31% share of the world's cloud market.

The broad migration of computing to the cloud has made it a natural tie-in with AI since companies using AI will almost assuredly power it through the cloud like they would their other technology. Most of the world's cloud market belongs to a big-tech trio of Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Amazon's proven ability to create and grow new businesses makes it my pick here. Amazon is an e-commerce and cloud juggernaut and is building a massive advertising business that could become a bigger deal down the road.

Buy Amazon for its AI upside via AWS, but its collective business and growth-focused culture (despite its massive size) have made the stock one of the best long-term investments ever. I expect Amazon to continue creating wealth for investors for the foreseeable future.

No company has first-party data like Alphabet

Data is the last ingredient of AI, as it needs data to train and learn. Alphabet controls 90% of the world's internet searches via Google, which has dominated for more than two decades to the extent that it was formally declared a monopoly earlier this year in court after the U.S. Justice Department sued Alphabet for anticompetitive practices. Alphabet has data on nearly everything anyone has ever searched for online, an unimaginably powerful trove of first-party data that can't be replicated anywhere else.

It goes beyond Google. Alphabet owns YouTube, the world's largest video platform, and Android, the mobile operating system used by 70% of the world's smartphones. An estimated 3 billion people use Google software applications like Gmail to organize their lives. You might say that Alphabet knows you better than you know yourself since it has access to virtually every interaction you've had with a computer or smartphone.

It remains to be seen what will happen to Alphabet due to its antitrust suit. Still, Alphabet represents an all-in-one AI package with a data advantage over arguably any other AI company and the vast financial resources to build on that advantage. Like Amazon, the company's AI opportunities will likely create immense value for shareholders over the coming decades.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,1022

2024-10-22 13:39:53,AI predicts Google stock price for year-end,https://finbold.com/ai-predicts-google-stock-price-for-year-end/,"After reaching an all-time high of $192 in early July, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has experienced a pullback due to a mix of antitrust pressures and growing competition in the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape.

With Alphabet’s Q3 earnings report set for release on October 29, investors are eagerly awaiting insights into how these developments are affecting the tech giant’s outlook.

Currently trading at $164, with a modest 1% gain over the past month, investors are left wondering where Google’s stock will land by the end of 2024.

To provide a clearer outlook, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o, which predicted that Google could see its stock price reach between $170 and $190 by the end of 2024, driven by several key factors.

A significant overhang for Google is the ongoing antitrust case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, accusing the tech giant of maintaining an illegal monopoly in search and text advertising.

Google recently achieved a temporary victory by securing a delay in the enforcement of court-mandated remedies related to its Play Store.

This decision is part of a broader legal battle involving game developer Epic Games and companies like Google, Apple, and Samsung over the availability of third-party app stores on their platforms.

Although Google has had some success in the courts, the legal challenges are far from over, and a potential adverse outcome could have long-term implications for the company’s core business.

Google’s dominance in the search engine market is being eroded by emerging AI competitors like Perplexity and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. eMarketer predicts Google’s U.S. search ad market share will drop below 50% for the first time in over a decade by next year.

Despite increasing competition, Google has made significant moves in AI. A recent partnership with Honeywell stands out, with Google’s Gemini AI poised to revolutionize industrial efficiency for the manufacturing giant.

This collaboration marks Google’s push beyond its core search business, tapping into industrial AI applications to create new revenue streams. While concerns over AI disrupting Google’s core business persist, these strategic partnerships offer a promising path for future growth.

Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle division, Waymo, continues to lead the robotaxi race despite stiff competition. Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) recent underwhelming robotaxi event has only boosted Waymo’s lead, with analysts predicting that Waymo could significantly scale its operations well ahead of Tesla becoming a serious contender.

Notably, Wall Street analysts have yet to fully account for Waymo’s growth in Alphabet’s overall valuation. This suggests there is untapped upside potential if Waymo continues to execute its strategy successfully, offering a promising avenue for Alphabet’s long-term growth.

Given these factors, AI-driven models predict that Google’s stock could reach $190 by the end of 2024. This projection assumes that Google’s legal challenges don’t escalate and that Waymo’s expansion gains further traction, offsetting the pressures from rising AI competition.

However, if antitrust rulings and AI rivals further erode Google’s market share, a more conservative year-end price closer to $170 is possible, representing a modest increase from the current price of $164.

In conclusion, Google’s stock trajectory for the rest of 2024 will depend on how well it navigates legal challenges and AI competition while capitalizing on growth opportunities in its AI and autonomous vehicle divisions.

Investors should watch for further developments, particularly around the October 29 earnings report, which could provide crucial insights into Alphabet’s future.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,719

Anthropic is the company behind Claude — one of the chatbots that, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, has exploded in popularity. Startups like Anthropic, alongside tech giants such as Google , Amazon , Microsoft and Meta, are all part of a generative AI arms race to ensure they don't fall behind in a market predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.

Anthropic's new Computer Use capability, part of its two newest AI models, allows its tech to interpret what's on a computer screen, select buttons, enter text, navigate websites and execute tasks through any software and real-time internet browsing.

The tool can ""use computers in basically the same way that we do,"" Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview, adding it can do tasks with ""tens or even hundreds of steps.""

Amazon had early access to the tool, Anthropic told CNBC, and early customers and beta testers included Asana, Canva and Notion. The company has been working on the tool since early this year, according to Kaplan.

Anthropic released the feature Tuesday in public beta for developers. The team hopes to open up use to consumers and enterprise clients over the next few months, or early next year, per Kaplan.

Anthropic said that future consumer applications include booking flights, scheduling appointments, filling out forms, conducting online research and filing expense reports.

""We want Claude to be able to actually assist people with all sorts of different kinds of work, and we think the chatbot setup is fairly limited because you can ask a question and [get] context but it stops there,"" Kaplan told CNBC.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,382
2024-10-22 08:11:02,Tesla Or Google? Who Will Steer The Future Of Self-Driving?,https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/technicals/24/10/41449625/tesla-or-google-who-will-steer-the-future-of-self-driving,"In the autonomous vehicle battle, Tesla Inc TSLA and Alphabet Inc‘s GOOGL GOOG Google's Waymo are squaring off to dominate the roads, but each is taking a radically different path.

Tesla's Elon Musk aims to revolutionize driving with the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) tech, while Google's Waymo is focused on perfecting fully autonomous vehicles.

As the self-drive race heats up, who's really in the driver's seat?

Tesla: Data Is King, But Sentiment Is Mixed

Despite its flashy robotaxi event underwhelming Wall Street, Tesla has a strong advocate in Anthony Levandowski, co-founder of Google's own self-driving program, now Waymo.

Levandowski points to one key factor: data. According to Business Insider, Tesla's fleet constantly gathers driving data from millions of vehicles, giving it a massive advantage.

It's not just about software, but having the most real-world data to refine that software.

Technically speaking, though, TSLA stock is hitting some bumps. With its stock down 11.90% year-to-date and trading below key moving averages like the five-day, 20-day and 50-day, signals are bearish.

TSLA stock’s current price of $218.85 against its eight-day SMA of $219.41 suggests selling pressure, and a MACD indicator at a negative 3.92 flags more downside.

On the bright side, the 200-day moving average at $201.40 gives bulls some hope for a rebound, but overall sentiment leans negative.

Waymo, Google’s self-driving division, has been pushing forward with full autonomy. Levandowski may prefer Tesla's data advantage, but Waymo remains one of the most advanced in terms of testing fully driverless cars.

For Alphabet, self-driving cars are an intriguing side bet with long-term growth potential. If successful, it could become a key driver alongside Google's core tech empire.

On the charts, GOOGL stock is experiencing bullish pressure, with its stock price of $164.07 trading above the eight-day and 50-day SMAs.

The RSI at 52.23 is Neutral, but MACD remains in positive territory at 0.58, suggesting a potential upside. With an 18.8% year-to-date gain, GOOGL stock's broader portfolio strength remains intact, even if Waymo’s road to commercialization is still bumpy.

While Tesla's data dominance could accelerate its progress in the self-drive race, Google's methodical, tech-driven approach ensures it remains a formidable player.

Investors betting on the future of autonomous driving will need to pick their team—will it be Tesla's data-driven revolution or Google's cautious, calculated moves with Waymo?",GOOGL,yes,fmp,589
2024-10-22 04:45:00,1 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That's a No-Brainer Buy,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/22/1-top-ai-stock-thats-no-brainer-buy/,"This company was a longtime mover and shaker in AI (and may still be a leader).

When it comes to stocks driven by the increased interest in all things having to do with artificial intelligence (AI), investors have gravitated to Nvidia. In a sense, this is understandable, as Nvidia's vision brought about an early lead in the AI chip industry amid the sudden demand for generative AI capabilities.

The problem with this focus is that the AI industry extends far beyond Nvidia. That might lead one to overlook opportunities that could potentially match or even outshine that stock going forward. Given the dynamics of the AI industry, it might be time for investors to pivot to AI leaders like Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%).

AI investors should stay aware of Alphabet as it is one of the original AI stocks. The company first began utilizing AI back in 2001 when it began applying spell checks to Google searches. Its AI technology advanced from that point, and for years, most industry analysts saw it as an AI leader.

However, that changed in the spring of 2023 when OpenAI released its latest version of the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. That company partnered with rival Microsoft and ran its servers on Nvidia chips, appearing to leave Alphabet and its companies out of the mix.

Despite the perception the Microsoft/OpenAI deal created, it is unclear whether Alphabet is ""behind"" in AI. The company responded quickly by launching its own updated generative AI chatbot Bard in the spring of 2023, following that up with Google Gemini in December of that year.

Moreover, it has taken a different approach to AI, leveraging its Google Research and Google DeepMind teams to emphasize the development of every layer of the AI stack. It focuses heavily on the ethics and safety issues that may come with AI. Additionally, it has developed one of the more popular AI libraries with TensorFlow, a free, open-source library for machine learning. That perspective could help Alphabet stand out as the awareness of AI's potential grows.

Investors should also remember that the Google parent holds almost $101 billion in liquidity. This gives it tremendous resources to succeed with AI. Furthermore, in the first half of the year alone, Alphabet generated more than $30 billion in free cash flow, bringing added flexibility to help the company address any technical gaps.

Indeed, the financials show it is not as bad off as some investors might assume. In the first half of 2024, Alphabet's revenue grew 14% yearly to $165 billion. Also, since the company held cost and expense growth to just 7%, net income rose to $47 billion during that period, a 42% yearly increase.

Also, one number in the financials highlights the importance of AI in the company's growth trajectory -- namely, the performance of Google Cloud. It accounted for $20 billion of the company's revenue in the first two quarters of 2024 and experienced a 28% annual increase, roughly double Alphabet's overall revenue growth rate during that time.

Moreover, while Google Cloud lags Amazon and Microsoft in that industry, its market positioning shows it plays a critical role in the cloud industry, emphasizing its need to succeed in AI.

To that end, many investors appear to still hold faith in Alphabet stock, which is up by almost 20% over the last year. Additionally, a pullback in the stock price has left it with a P/E ratio of 24, the lowest among its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers. That lower valuation could lead investors back into the stock as more come to appreciate the company's competitive position in the AI industry.

Given the company's position and stock performance, it is likely time for investors to come back to Alphabet stock. Indeed, some of its competitors have made significant strides in AI, leaving many to wonder whether the Google parent is still a market leader in this technology.

However, the company was quick to respond with its own generative AI offerings. Also, since the cloud plays a critical role in implementing AI, Google Cloud has helped invigorate the company's growth.

Ultimately, it is likely too early to write off Alphabet in the AI race. With a rising stock price and a low valuation among its mega-tech competitors, investors should consider following the Google parent more closely.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,875
2024-10-21 19:41:42,"Honeywell, Google Join Forces to Build AI-Driven Industrial Operations",https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2024/honeywell-google-join-forces-to-build-ai-driven-industrial-operations/,"Honeywell and Google Cloud are partnering to transform the industrial sector by integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) agents into operations.

The two companies announced their collaboration in a press release Monday (Oct. 21). The solutions, which are expected to begin rolling out in 2025, will leverage Honeywell’s Internet of Things platform, Honeywell Forge, and Google Cloud’s AI capabilities, particularly the Gemini platform on Vertex AI.

Besides enhancing efficiency by connecting assets, personnel and processes, the AI-driven solutions are also supposed to address the labor shortages facing many industries by making operations more autonomous.

As the baby boom population retires, the industrial sector is more shorthanded. According to Honeywell’s 2024 Industrial AI Insights report, while 82% of industrial leaders consider their organizations early adopters of AI, only 17% of them have fully implemented their initial strategies.

The Honeywell-Google partnership aims to bridge that gap by deploying AI agents that help upskill the workforce. Or as Honeywell Chairman and CEO Vimal Kapur said in the release, “The path to autonomy requires assets working harder, people working smarter, and processes working more efficiently.”

In addition, Honeywell and Google Cloud plan to co-develop specialized industrial AI agents designed to automate project design cycles and streamline maintenance tasks. These agents will use Google’s large language models to assist technicians in resolving issues more efficiently by processing various data types — including images, videos, text and sensor readings — leading to better decision-making on the factory floor.

According to the release, the partnership will also integrate Google Threat Intelligence into Honeywell’s cybersecurity offerings, enhancing threat detection for industrial customers and the security of critical infrastructure.

“Looking ahead, Honeywell will explore using Google’s Gemini Nano model to enhance Honeywell edge AI devices’ intelligence multiple use cases across verticals, ranging from scanning performance to voice-based guided workflow, maintenance, operational and alarm assist without the need to connect to the internet and cloud. This is the beginning of a new wave of more intelligent devices and solutions, which will be the subject of future Honeywell announcements,” the release said.

Unless there’s an influx of young talent that joins the industrial sector, companies will depend on automation and autonomy for their operations. To adjust, there may be more collaborative harnessing of AI tools.

2024-10-21 13:00:01,How your online world could change if big tech companies like Google are forced to break up,https://techxplore.com/news/2024-10-online-world-big-tech-companies.html,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

The US Department of Justice may be on the verge of seeking a break-up of Google in a bid to make it less dominant. If the government goes ahead and is successful in the courts, it could mean the company being split into separate entities—a search engine, an advertising company, a video website, a mapping app—which would not be allowed to share data with each other.

While this is still a distant prospect, it is being considered in the wake of a series of rulings in the US and the EU which suggest that regulators are becoming increasingly frustrated by the power of big tech. That power tends to be highly concentrated, whether it's Google's monopoly as a search engine, Meta's data gathering from Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, or by small businesses becoming dependent on Amazon.

But what would a breakup of these tech giants achieve for consumers? Those in favor of shaking up Silicon Valley in this way argue that it would lead to more competition and more choice. And the best-case future scenario might look something like this:

The year is 2030, and you are on your way to meet a friend for a meal. You receive a message notification on WhatsApp, which was sent by your friend using her Signal messaging app. Sending and receiving messages from different apps is now so common you barely notice it.

In fact, ""interoperability""—where different systems and tech work seamlessly together—is everywhere. In the same way you could send an email from Gmail to Hotmail back in 2024, you can now choose from a range of social media apps—alongside Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat—with text, pictures and video posted on one network easily accessible via another.

You choose an app because you like the way it looks or the way it filters and presents content —not just because everyone else is on it.

Similarly, your choice of restaurant and information on directions came from apps you have chosen from a much wider selection than the one you had access to back in 2024. You look at reviews produced by people you follow, irrespective of the platform they used to share it.

Product placement and AI-generated content have practically disappeared, as the mapping app does not want to risk giving you advice you don't want. If it did, you would simply switch to a competitor which provides a superior service.

This increased level of competition is central to those who argue for breaking up big tech. Instead of app developers having to pay 30% of their sales to Google or Apple, there would be numerous app stores available, all competing to offer the best apps by cutting their profit margins. The theory is that the app market—and technological innovation—would thrive as a result.

Research also suggests that the existence of competing apps makes consumers less lazy, and forces businesses to deliver better products, and better value for money.

In 2024, you would have had to trust the results provided to you by Google search, Google Maps, or a Google advert. And because Google owned your data, it could auction information about you to other businesses trying to reach you, without your say.

You might have found Google's services useful, but most of the benefit from personalized data would have gone to Google. And another big change that could come from breaking up big tech is that you might finally become the unique owner of that data.

Potentially, you would be the only one with full access to your browsing history—the products you searched for, the ones you bought and the ones you almost bought. You would own the information about where you went for lunch, what you ordered, and how much you spent.

Other information that would be owned by you might include how you commute to work, which video clips make you laugh, and which books you finished and the ones you abandoned immediately. The same goes for how you met your partner online, your dating history, and the health data your watch has collected about how hard you work at the gym.

In the imagined year of 2030, you would keep this data on an encrypted server, and different companies would offer apps to help you organize and manage your information. Whenever you wanted to, you could decide to use your data for your own purposes.

Breaking up is hard to do

Splitting up big tech companies is not without risks however. An obvious consequence is that those big companies would be less profitable.

Right now, Google and Meta make (a lot of) money from advertising, and this is only possible because they own so much information about us. If they didn't, they might end up charging users for the services they provide.

Interoperability and greater competition may also provide more room for scam app operators. And while more choice about apps may be fine for some, it may be problematic for those who find modern technology challenging enough already.

For regulators though, the challenge of modern technology seems to be a sense of powerlessness. And if they do decide to take the radical option and break up dominant companies, it could make a big difference to the online world for all of us.

2024-10-21 07:46:32,Honeywell signs deal with Google to bring Gemini generative AI to industrial sector,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/honeywell-signs-deal-with-google-gemini-for-industrial-gen-ai.html,"Google Gemini, the flagship generative AI from Alphabet , is is being tapped by Honeywell to provide insights across the industrial giant's massive data set that can lead to reduced maintenance costs, increased productivity and opportunities to upskill employees.

""The path to autonomy requires assets working harder, people working smarter and processes working more efficiently,"" said Vimal Kapur, Honeywell CEO, in a statement announcing the collaboration, which will begin offering gen AI insights to industrial clients in 2025.

Kapur recently told CNBC that the biggest problems AI can solve in an industrial context start with a generational labor shortage, with declining birth rates in the industrialized world resulting in less available workers to do jobs that were popular 25 years ago. ""Everyone has that problem in industrials,"" he said at the recent CNBC Evolve AI Opportunity event. Kapur told CNBC that AI will allow an employee with five years of experience to operate at the same level as an employee with 15 years of experience through the help of AI co-pilots.

AI-powered agents offered through Google will help automate tasks for engineers and help technicians resolve maintenance issues. Kapur had told CNBC at the recent event that Honeywell will soon be embedding connectivity within jet engines to enable predictive maintenance and reduce time needed for work in shops.

Honeywell says while gen AI is already being used within the industrials sector, this partnership will take the opportunity to a higher level than current ""gen AI point solutions,"" going ""beyond simple chat and predictions"" by connecting Google AI to the Honeywell Forge IoT platform.

Honeywell Forge, an Internet of Things platform that includes information from industrial designs, manuals, and real-world performance of Honeywell products, will leverage Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Google's large language models to build AI agents trained on this data.

""We're moving from automation to autonomy,"" said Suresh Venkatarayalu, Honeywell's CTO and president of Honeywell Connected Enterprise, in a Google blog post about the deal. ""Our goal is to equip companies with AI agents that assist workers in real time — on factory floors and in the field.""

Workers will be able to ask the AI questions like, ""How did this unit perform last night?"" or ""Why is my system making this sound?"" according to the companies.

The Google AI will offer images, videos, text and sensor readings to engineers.

""Industrial companies play a crucial role in our daily lives, whether it's the airplanes we fly, the medical devices we use or the sensors that manage the air conditioning in our offices,"" said Carrie Tharp, vice president of strategic industries at Google Cloud, in the blog post. ""With an entire generation of workers retiring and — in many cases — no one coming behind them, industrial companies are under tremendous pressure.""

Honeywell said it is also exploring use of Gemini Nano, an on-device version of the AI, for operations in data centers, hospitals, refineries and warehouses, among other locations, and in particular in rural locations where internet connectivity can be an issue. Gemini Nano can provide AI directly on scanners, sensors and controllers for autonomous operations.

For the AI giants like Google, getting industries across the economy to adopt gen AI is crucial to turning a capital-intensive technology into a profitable opportunity. According to Honeywell data, 82% of companies in the industrial sector that consider themselves AI leaders are behind on adoption, with only 17% having fully launched initial AI plans.

Companies across the economy are also hoping that their internal data becomes as valuable as the large language models like Gemini powering the gen AI boom. Clément Delangue, co-founder and CEO of Hugging Face, one of the most highly valued gen AI startups in the world, with backing from Amazon, Nvidia, and Google, said at the CNBC Evolve AI Opportunity event that ""data and data sets are the next frontier for AI."" He noted that on Hugging Face's platform, which uses an open-source approach to develop AI models, there are over 200,000 public data sets that have been shared, and the growth rate of data sets being added to the platform is faster than the growth rate of new large language models.

""The world is going to evolve to where it's every single company, every single industry, even every single use case having their own specific customized models,"" Delangue said.

Siemens and Microsoft announced a gen AI deal for the industrial sector late last year, which included an AI copilot for use across industries.

Kapur views gen AI as a growth opportunity for the labor-challenged industrial sector which will open up new revenue opportunities rather than as a productivity tool first and foremost, and he is bullish on the adoption curve steepening quickly. ""Awareness is high, adoption is low, but there will be an inflection point,"" he said at the recent CNBC AI event. ""I do believe 2025-2026 will be a big year for adoption of AI in the context of industrials.""",GOOGL,yes,fmp,1007

Hassabis also believes AGI could solve problems related to energy production and climate change. And he is not alone in making bold predictions.

Dario Amodei, CEO of AI start-up Anthropic, says the emergence superintelligence could lead to the eradication of most infectious diseases, the elimination of most cancers, and the mitigation of climate change. Amodei also thinks AGI will support a doubling in the human lifespan, and he believes those changes could happen within a decade.

Even if those timelines are overly optimistic, companies that provide AI infrastructure and software services could create substantial wealth for investors in the coming years. Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%) and Datadog (DDOG 2.19%) fit that profile. The stocks over the last five years returned 160% and 305%, respectively, and the AI boom could lead to an even stronger performance over the next five years.

Here's what investors should know.

Alphabet subsidiary Google was recently recognized by Forrester Research as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure solutions and foundational large language models. The company is using its AI expertise to reinforce its leadership in digital advertising, and strengthen its position in cloud infrastructure and platform services (CIPS).

For instance, generative AI overviews are increasing usage and improving satisfaction with Google Search, especially among young adults aged 18 to 24, according to CEO Sundar Pichai. Similarly, the company has debuted AI-driven profit optimization tools for advertisers, as well as generative AI tools that automate media content creation and advertising campaign construction.

Additionally, Google Cloud Platform added over 500 updates last year for its machine learning platform Vertex AI, according to consultancy Gartner. Vertex lets users customize pretrained models like Gemini and build AI applications. Google still trails Amazon and Microsoft by a wide margin in CIPS, but its market share increased by a percentage point over the past year, according to Synergy Research.

Alphabet reported strong financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 14% to $84.7 billion due to momentum in the cloud computing segement, and modest growth in the advertising segement. Meanwhile, GAAP net income jumped 31% to $1.89 per diluted share as the company continued to prioritize disciplined cost control.

Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 23 times earnings look quite reasonable. Patient investors should feel confident buying a small position in this AI stock today.

Datadog provides observability software that helps businesses monitor, analyze, and fix performance issues across their IT infrastructure and applications. Its portfolio features artificial intelligence features that identify anomalies, surface insights, and automate root cause analysis. Consultancy Gartner has recognized Datadog as a leader in observability software for four consecutive years, and Forrester Research has recognized its leadership in AI for IT operations.

Observability software becomes more important as computing environments grow more complex. So, the proliferation of AI systems should be a major tailwind for Datadog, and it's leaning into that opportunity with LLM Observability, a performance monitoring product for large language models (LLMs). The company also introduced a natural language interface called Bits AI that leans on generative AI to accelerate incident investigation and response.

Datadog reported strong financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 27% to $645 million as its customer base expanded and existing customers spent more money. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income increased 48% to $0.43 per diluted share. Management also raised its full-year guidance, such that sales are projected to increase 23% in 2024.

Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Datadog's revenue to increase at 23% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 20 times sales look tolerable, and it represents a discount to the three-year average of 23.7 times sales. To be clear, the stock is not cheap at its current price, but patient investors should still consider buying a few shares. Datadog has a strong position in a software market that will become more critical as AI deployments increase.

Importantly, there is a reasonably good chance the stock will pull back at some point in the future, maybe by more than 20%. Investors should be comfortable with that possibility before purchasing shares today, and they should be willing to buy the dip if such a pullback occurs.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,1028
2024-10-20 09:15:00,"If You Bought 1 Share of Alphabet Stock at Its IPO, Here's How Many Shares You Would Own Now",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/20/if-you-bought-1-share-of-alphabet-stock-at-its-ipo/,"Sometimes, even stocks that begin as large caps can drive massive returns.

This year marks 20 years since Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%), known then as Google, Inc., launched its IPO. The company faced significant regulatory scrutiny at that time, and a desire to launch its IPO at a higher price gave way to pressure, pushing the IPO price down to a split-adjusted $2.13 per share.

Despite such challenges, the company evolved into a digital advertising juggernaut, and the profits generated from that business led to Alphabet acquiring numerous other companies. With that expansion, even an investor with one pre-split share earned massive gains over the last 20 years.

Investors who bought one share in 2004 would now hold 40 shares -- 20 shares with voting power under the ""GOOGL"" symbol and 20 that do not have voting rights and trade under the ""GOOG"" symbol.

This is because the company initiated an unusual 2-for-1 stock split in 2014 when it created a third class of non-voting shares (only insiders own the second class of shares, known as ""B"" shares). Also, each class of Alphabet stock split 20-for-1 in 2022, leading to the current weighting of shares.

Consequently, this holding in Alphabet would have yielded a total return of just under $6,700 today, including the dividend that began in the second quarter of 2024.

Admittedly, that gain might disappoint compared to the lifetime gains of Amazon, whose one share at the 1997 IPO is now worth about $34,000.

However, Amazon's market cap was only about $450 million at the time, meaning it had already doubled approximately six times when it reached Alphabet's IPO market cap of about $27 billion.

This distinction is important since, today, companies tend to launch IPOs when they have already reached large-cap status. Nonetheless, the Alphabet example shows that it is not too late to earn considerable gains from such a market cap. If one can apply these lessons to a future tech industry leader, massive returns are still possible.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,439

2024-10-20 05:32:00,Is Alphabet Stock a Buy Now?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/20/is-alphabet-stock-a-buy-now/,"Investors will find no shortage of reasons to appreciate this business.

Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%) shares have produced a monster 6,510% return since their initial public offering in 2004. That gain certainly made early investors rich. But shares are taking a breather, as they're down about 13% from their peak from July this year.

If you're considering buying this top technology stock, which is worth more than $2 trillion at the time of this writing, continue reading to understand why that's a very smart decision for your portfolio.

I think the mark of a truly outstanding company is the presence of an economic moat. In other words, does the business in question possess durable competitive advantages that allow it to succeed financially for an extended period of time? Alphabet certainly fits the bill here. In fact, there are likely multiple competitive strengths at play.

For starters, Alphabet benefits from network effects. Its Google Search engine becomes more valuable to all stakeholders, including internet users, website publishers, and advertisers, the larger it gets. And YouTube, the leading streaming service, becomes better as the content offerings and viewership grows.

With 15 products and services that are each used by half a billion people or more, Alphabet is able to collect more data than nearly all businesses on Earth. In the internet age, this is an advantage. Alphabet can use this valuable info to glean insights that can inform corporate strategy and product development efforts.

In the past five years, Alphabet's return on invested capital (ROIC) has averaged 23.8%. This means that for every $100 reinvested into the business, the company is able to earn about $24 in profit. The fact that Alphabet's ROIC is more than double that of the average for the S&P 500 clearly demonstrates just how wonderful this business really is. Companies that don't possess economic moats typically have consistently low ROIC metrics.

The market is full of growing and unprofitable businesses that aren't in the best financial shape. Investors who prioritize growth above all else might gravitate to these types of companies. But this adds risk to the equation. These unproven business models rely on favorable macroeconomic conditions in order to keep running.

Alphabet doesn't fall into this category. This company has been raking in profits for a very long time. For every $100 in revenue generated in Q2 (ended June 30), operating income was a stellar $32. Even during the digital ad market's weak period in 2022, Alphabet was still able to report an operating margin of 26%. The business has reached tremendous scale that allows it to leverage its expenses to the benefit of shareholders.

Alphabet produced $102 billion in operating cash flow last year. Management uses capital that's left after reinvesting into the business to fund ongoing share repurchases, as well as to help pay for the newly announced dividend. Risk is also drastically reduced because the company is sitting on a fortress balance sheet that has a current net cash position of $87 billion. This gives Alphabet the resources to invest in new areas, like artificial intelligence.

Alphabet has historically been a winning stock. And today, the company's market cap is north of $2 trillion. However, this doesn't mean that you're too late to the party. Even some of the most closely watched businesses are still worthy investment candidates.

As of this writing, Alphabet shares trade for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.8. This makes it the cheapest option among the popular ""Magnificent Seven"" grouping. Regulatory uncertainty might be the key factor weighing on the stock right now. But that doesn't take away from the fact that this is one of the highest-quality businesses out there. It deserves a spot in your portfolio.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,779
2024-10-20 04:15:00,2 Stocks That Could Join Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/20/2-stocks-join-nvidia-3-trillion-club/,"These top tech stocks could rise at least 50% in the next two years.

Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%) has been one of the best stocks to profit off the artificial intelligence (AI) boom over the last two years. Shares of the AI chip leader have surged more than 820% since 2022 and currently have of a market cap of nearly $3.3 trillion -- trailing only Apple's $3.5 trillion.

The following ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are not far behind and could deliver exceptional returns in the next few years to join Nvidia and Apple in the $3 trillion club.

Amazon (AMZN 0.78%) shares have delivered life-changing returns to investors over the last few decades and continue to generate market-beating gains. The stock has doubled over the last five years, bringing its total market cap to $2 trillion. Based on the company's opportunities, the shares could climb another 50% in the next few years to reach $3 trillion in total market value.

When you deliver billions of orders each year, every last mile of cost adds up. Amazon was able to reduce the cost to serve retail customers in 2023 for the first time since 2018. It continues to find ways to strip costs out of the retail business. The company's operating profit has doubled over the last year, as it shortens and optimizes delivery routes.

Reducing costs can benefit Amazon more than simply boosting its short-term profitability. It also can allow Amazon to gain market share in online shopping by lowering prices on select goods. Shortening transportation distances also means customers receive their orders faster, and that can lead to more frequent shopping.

Amazon says it has plenty of opportunities to reduce costs by using automation and robotics and continuing to build its same-day delivery network. The company already controlled 37% of the U.S. e-commerce market in 2023 -- 6 times the share of No. 2 Walmart, according to Statista. Amazon's efforts to improve efficiencies and speed up order delivery show a relentless competitor continuing to look for ways to protect and stretch its lead. This is the kind of business you want protecting and growing your savings for retirement.

Analysts expect earnings to reach $7.30 per share by 2026, an increase of 52% over 2024 estimates. Amazon investors can expect the stock to climb along with that increase and reach a $3 trillion market cap within two years.

Shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1.50%) (GOOGL 1.57%) also doubled in the last five years. The company's market cap is currently hovering around $2 trillion, putting it within striking distance of Nvidia's market value.

While Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud service provider for enterprises, many businesses prefer Google Cloud. Google has been steadily gaining share of the cloud market in recent years. New AI services offered in Google Cloud are fueling its momentum.

The company credited strong demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI services for driving recent growth in the cloud. Google Cloud's revenue grew to more than $10 billion in the second quarter, but equally important, the segment's operating profit nearly tripled to surpass $1.1 billion last quarter. This shows Alphabet is earning a high return on investment on AI tools offered to Google Cloud customers like Vertex and the Gemini AI model.

It's also impressive that Alphabet can make the necessary investments to drive strong demand for cloud services and AI while producing solid earnings growth. Earnings grew 31% year over year in Q2, and analysts expect Alphabet's earnings to grow 16% over the long term.

By 2026, the consensus estimate has Alphabet's earnings reaching $10. If Alphabet earns a market average price-to-earnings ratio of around 27, the shares could be worth $270, implying upside of 62%. It could easily hit a $3 trillion market cap in two years.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,796

Sunday marks the official start of a health-care technology conference called HLTH, which is expected to draw more than 12,000 industry leaders this year. CNBC will be on the ground. Based on the speaking agenda and announcements leading up to the conference, AI tools to conquer administrative burdens will be the star of this year's show. Doctors and nurses are responsible for mountains of documentation as they work to keep up with patient records, interface with insurance companies and comply with regulators. Often, these tasks are painstakingly manual, in part because health data is siloed and stored across multiple vendors and formats. The daunting administrative workload is a major cause of burnout in the industry, and it's part of the reason a nationwide shortage of 100,000 health-care workers is expected by 2028, according to consulting firm Mercer. Tech companies, eager to carve out a piece of a market that could top $6.8 trillion in spending by the decade's end, argue that their generative AI tools can help.

Google, for instance, said it's working to expand its health-care customer base by tackling administrative burden with AI. On Thursday, the company announced the general availability of Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, which it introduced in a trial capacity during HLTH last year. Vertex AI Search for Healthcare allows developers to build tools to help doctors quickly search for information across disparate medical records, Google said. New features within Google's Healthcare Data Engine, which helps organizations build the platforms they need to support generative AI, are also now available, the company said. Google on Thursday released the results of a survey that said clinicians spend nearly 28 hours a week on administrative tasks. In the survey, 80% of providers said this clerical work takes away from their time with patients, and 91% said they feel positive about using AI to streamline these tasks.

Similarly, Microsoft on Oct. 11 announced its collection of tools that aim to lessen clinicians' administrative workload, including medical imaging models, a health-care agent service and an automated documentation solution for nurses, most of which are still in the early stages of development. Microsoft already offers an automated documentation tool for doctors through its subsidiary, Nuance Communications, which it acquired in a $16 billion deal in 2021. The tool, called DAX Copilot, uses AI to transcribe doctors' visits with patients and turn them into clinical notes and summaries. Ideally, this means doctors don't have to spend time typing out these notes themselves. Nurses and doctors complete different types of documentation during their shifts, so Microsoft said it's building a separate tool for nurses that's best suited to their workflows. AI scribe tools such as DAX Copilot have exploded in popularity this year, and Nuance's competitors, such as Abridge, which has reportedly raised more than $460 million, and Suki, which has raised $165 million, will also be at the HLTH conference. Dr. Shiv Rao, the founder and CEO of Abridge, told CNBC in March that the rate at which the health-care industry has adopted this new form of clinical documentation feels ""historic."" Abridge received a coveted investment from Nvidia's venture capital arm that same month.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,680

2024-10-19 06:40:01,Google wins delay in opening Android app store to rivals,https://techxplore.com/news/2024-10-google-delay-android-app-rivals.html,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

A US judge on Friday let Google delay opening Android-powered smartphones to rival app shops, suspending a November 1 deadline ordered in an antitrust case brought by Fortnite-maker Epic Games.

Google was pleased by federal judge James Donato's decision to ""temporarily pause the implementation of dangerous remedies demanded by Epic,"" a company spokesperson said, as an appeals court considers permanently blocking the order stemming from Epic's argument that the tech titan's Android Play store is an illegal monopoly.

""These remedies threaten Google Play's ability to provide a safe and secure experience and we look forward to continuing to make our case,"" the spokesperson added.

In response to the ruling, a spokesperson for Epic Games said in an email to AFP that Google's appeal was ""meritless,"" citing the judge's deference to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals instead of striking down the order outright.

""The pause... is merely a procedural step,"" the spokesperson said.

Phones running on the Android operating system have about a 70 percent share of the world's smartphone market.

Google has been hit with a series of recent legal challenges to its dominance.

In August, a different judge found that Google's world-leading search engine was an illegal monopoly.

Google is also facing an antitrust lawsuit in a third federal case in Virginia over its dominance of online advertising.

Under the Epic Games order, for the next three years Google will be prohibited from engaging in several practices that were deemed anticompetitive by the jury in the landmark case.

For instance, the trial found that Google made its Play app store the only method to make payments to third party apps, like Fortnite.

A sizable chunk of app store revenue comes from video games, and Epic Games has long sought to have payments for its mobile games take place outside the Google or Apple app stores that take commissions as high as 30 percent.

Epic mostly lost a similar case against Apple, where a US judge largely ruled in favor of the iPhone-maker.

Apple and Google regularly argue that their app shop commissions are industry standard, and that they pay for benefits such as reach, transaction security and ferreting out malware.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,451
2024-10-18 16:57:38,Judge Grants Google Emergency Stay Motion in Epic Games Ruling,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/judge-grants-google-emergency-stay-motion-in-epic-games-ruling/,"Google has succeeded in convincing a US District Court judge in California to put the brakes on an injunction requiring the company to open up its Play Store to third-party app stores. The Friday decision by Judge James Donato came a day after Google filed a request for an emergency stay with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Donato's decision will allow time for the appeals court to consider that request.

The decision is the latest chapter in an ongoing legal battle between game developer and publisher Epic Games and companies including Google, Apple and Samsung over making third-party app stores available to users on their platforms.

Epic has balked at fees and restrictions when it has offered games on Apple's App Store and Google Play and has sought other avenues to offer its games, including Fortnite. An early October ruling against Google would have required the company to make changes to its Play Store by Nov. 1.

In the emergency stay motion and a fact sheet published by Google, the company argued that the task of making changes to the Play Store by then is too great to accomplish without harming safety and privacy and ""puts users at risk.""

After Donato's decision, Google said in a statement, ""We're pleased with the District Court's decision to temporarily pause the implementation of dangerous remedies demanded by Epic, as the Court of Appeal considers our request to further pause the remedies while we appeal.""

A statement from Epic Games had a different take on the decision.

""The pause in the injunction is merely a procedural step to allow the Ninth Circuit time to decide Google's request to stay the injunction pending appeal,"" the statement read in part.

In the fact sheet, Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president for regulatory affairs, says that 500,000 US developers and 100 million Android users in the US could be made vulnerable by the changes Google would have needed to make to meet the original order's deadline.

""This wouldn't just hurt Google – this would have negative consequences for Android users, developers and device manufacturers who have built thriving businesses on Android,"" Mulholland wrote.

Some of the justifications in the ruling and fact sheet point to the dangers of external links within the Play Store to external app downloads, eliminating protections within billing Google says its Play service offers and rushing the process of making changes.

""The jury's verdict and the court's injunction were clear: Google's anticompetitive Play Store practices are illegal,"" Epic Games said in a statement sent to CNET.

""Google is merely fear mongering and falsely using security as a pretext to delay the changes mandated by the court. This is Google's last ditch effort to protect their control over Android and continue extracting exorbitant fees. The court's injunction must go into effect swiftly so developers and consumers can benefit from competition in the mobile ecosystem.""

Earnings season has officially kicked off for Wall Street. Over a roughly six-week stretch, a majority of S&P 500 companies will report their operating results from the latest quarter and offer insight on the health of the U.S. economy and consumer.

But earnings season is far from the only important data dump investors are privy to each quarter.

On Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This invaluable filing allows investors to see what Wall Street's smartest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter.

To be transparent, 13Fs aren't perfect. They can be 45 days old, when filed, which means they're presenting stale information for active hedge funds. Nevertheless, 13Fs provide insight into which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's most-prominent asset managers.

The June-ended quarter was a particularly active period for billionaire Seth Klarman, the CEO and portfolio manager of Baupost Group. The value-focused Klarman, who's modeled his investment philosophy after Benjamin Graham, is overseeing $3.6 billion of invested assets spread across close to two dozen holdings.

Perhaps the most noteworthy move made by Klarman in the second quarter was to meaningfully pare down the cheapest of all ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%). At the same time, Klarman willingly piled into an off-the-radar, but historically inexpensive, drug stock.

Klarman's Baupost jettisoned a significant portion of its stake in Alphabet

Baupost first initiated a position in Alphabet's Class C shares (GOOG) during the first quarter of 2020 (i.e., during the COVID-19 crash). As of March 31, Klarman's fund held north of 2.9 million shares. But over the course of three months, ended June 30, Baupost's investment leaders, including Klarman, sent 1,888,064 shares of Alphabet to the chopping block, representing a 64% reduction.

While profit-taking is a viable reason for Seth Klarman and his team to reduce their fund's stake in Google, YouTube, and Waymo parent Alphabet by nearly two-thirds, I believe there may four other possible explanations.

To start with, Klarman and his crew might be concerned about the stock market being historically pricey. The S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly referred to as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE ratio), hit its highest level of the year earlier this week (37.70), and has more than doubled its average reading of 17.16, dating back to January 1871. Even though Alphabet's forward P/E ratio is a reasonably low 19, the company's shares would undoubtedly be weighed down if the broad-market indexes were to roll over.

Alphabet's valuation might be another tipping point for Baupost's chief. Despite Alphabet's stock trading below its average forward P/E multiple over the last five years, it's pricier than its average book value over the last five years, and is no longer the screaming bargain it's been relative to its cash flow. Klarman tends to focus heavily on these traditional fundamental measures of value.

A third possibility behind this aggressive selling activity in Alphabet's Class C stock is the potential for the U.S. to fall into a recession. The first notable decline in M2 money supply since the Great Depression, along with the longest yield-curve inversion in history, suggest the U.S. economy can stumble in the coming quarters. With Alphabet generating 76% of its net sales from advertising during the June-ended quarter, it would be susceptible to weakness if economic growth were to slow or shift into reverse.

Lastly, Baupost Group's smartest investment minds may have foreseen legal troubles to come for Alphabet. Specifically, the U.S. Justice Department may seek a breakup of Alphabet due to its utter dominance of internet search. Uncertainty tends to be the enemy of investors.

For what it's worth, I believe this is a decision Klarman will eventually regret. But with the stock market historically pricey and Klarman being an ardent value investor, this selling activity does makes sense.

Klarman is scooping up shares of a jaw-droppingly cheap pharma stock

On the other end of the spectrum, Klarman and his team added to nine of Baupost Group's existing positions during the second quarter. Arguably none of these purchases stands out more than drug developer Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ 1.39%).

During the June-ended quarter, Klarman oversaw the addition of 440,552 shares of Jazz, which increased his fund's stake in the company by 53% to 1,274,248 shares. As of the midpoint of 2024, Jazz Pharmaceuticals was Baupost's ninth-largest holding, worth $136 million.

Jazz's oxybate franchise, which is comprised of Xyrem and Xywav (two therapies focused on treating sleep disorders), are what make the company tick. Xyrem was Jazz's blockbuster narcolepsy treatment, while Xywav is its next-generation sleep-disorder therapy. Xywav contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem, which makes it an ideal sleep-disorder therapy for people with cardiovascular concerns. Based on revenue through the first-half of 2024, Jazz's oxybate franchise is pacing $1.6 billion in sales for the current year.

Jazz is also looking for its cannabidiol (CBD)-based therapy, Epidiolex (known as Epidyolex overseas), to eventually reach blockbuster status. Epidiolex was the crown jewel of the $7.2 billion GW Pharmaceuticals acquisition by Jazz in May 2021. It treats rare forms of epilepsy and has limited competition, which has paved a path to steady double-digit sales growth. Epidiolex looks to be on track to generate close to $900 million in full-year revenue in 2024.

Furthermore, Jazz's oncology segment topped $1 billion in annual sales for the first time in 2023. Much of this growth was fueled by injectable therapy Rylaze, which is a treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Improved cancer-screening diagnostics and substantive pricing power should lift oncology segment sales to at least $1.1 billion this year.

Despite steady long-term growth from all three facets of the company's drug portfolio, there's concern that Avadel Pharmaceuticals may eat into Jazz's dominance of the sleep disorder space. Avadel commercially launched Lumryz in the U.S. five months ago, which is a therapy that directly competes with Jazz's oxybate franchise in select indications.

However, a strong argument can be made that these competitive concerns are fully baked in. Shares of Jazz are valued at a little over 5 times Wall Street's consensus earnings per share (EPS) forecast for 2025. This represents a 32% discount to the company's average forward P/E over the trailing-five-year period.

What's more, Jazz Pharmaceuticals has a robust pipeline that currently features more than 30 clinical trials. While there are a handful of label expansion opportunities for Epidiolex, the company's future revolves around its oncology pipeline, which is targeting small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia, among other indications. Just a few wins among these 30-plus trials can be huge for Jazz.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,1615
2024-10-18 04:02:00,"Meet the Unstoppable Growth Stock That Could Join Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club by 2028.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/18/meet-the-unstoppable-growth-stock-that-could-join/,"Robust growth and an improving economy should help drive this tech stalwart to new heights.

It was a mere 20 years ago that industrial and energy titans General Electric and ExxonMobil were the world's most valuable companies when measured by market cap, with values of $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Now, just two decades later, technology interests lead the field.

Heading up the list are some of the world's most familiar technology names. Apple tops the charts at $3.5 trillion (as of this writing). Nvidia and Microsoft are trailing close behind, with market caps of $3.2 trillion and $3.1 trillion, respectively.

With a market cap of just $2 trillion, it might seem a bit early to suggest that Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%) has the makings for membership in the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 88% since early last year and 172% over the past five years, and there's every reason to believe its ascent will continue.

A combination of an improving economy, Alphabet's market strength, and gains in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) could provide the boost the company needs to join this exclusive society.

The widespread challenges of the past few years have been glaringly obvious, marked by macroeconomic headwinds and the worst inflation rates since the early 1980s. These conditions weighed heavily on each of Alphabet's major business segments and the stock plunged as much as 44% in response.

However, there's been a marked improvement in recent months. In September, the Federal Reserve Bank cut interest rates for the first time since March 2020, and consumer confidence jumped to its highest level in months.

The economic rebound has had a dramatic effect on Alphabet's results. In the second quarter, revenue of $84.7 billion climbed 14% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.89 jumped 31%.

Each of the company's major operating segments did their part to boost the results. The rebound in advertising, which has suffered the most in recent years, had the most profound impact. Google advertising, which provides the bulk of Alphabet's revenue, climbed 11% year over year, while Google Cloud -- the company's fastest-growing segment -- jumped 29%.

An industry leader -- in more ways than one

Google has long been the undisputed leader in search, recently capturing 90% of the search market, according to internet statistics aggregator StatCounter. The company has worked to consistently improve its search acumen and the underlying algorithms, becoming something of an AI subject matter expert along the way.

It's also the undisputed leader in digital advertising, fueled primarily by Google Search and YouTube but also by its suite of products that count billions of users each. In 2023, Google captured an estimated 39% of worldwide digital advertising revenue, according to data compiled by Statista. For context, its closest competitor -- Meta Platforms -- garnered just 18%. This dominance is expected to continue.

Alphabet is also a strong contender in the realm of cloud computing. Google Cloud is part of the ""Big Three"" as the third-largest provider of cloud infrastructure services. The company controlled roughly 10% of the market in the second quarter, according to data supplied by Canalys. It was also the fastest-growing, with year-over-year revenue growth of 30%.

Helping fuel demand for Google Cloud is the company's generative AI offerings. Alphabet has been using AI for years to inform its search results, and the company has refocused that expertise to fuel a suite of AI-powered models led by Gemini, one of the leading foundational AI models in the world. This is attracting new users to Google Cloud.

I'd be remiss if I didn't address the elephant in the room. The antitrust case against Alphabet is one step closer to completion. The court found that Google had violated antitrust law, and the U.S. Justice Department is mulling recommendations regarding the appropriate remedies, though the judge will have the final say. One of the potential outcomes is a breakup of the company, which is something that hasn't happened in decades. There are other less severe proposals, like sharing Google's search code with rivals, blocking other providers from paying Google to be its default search engine and more.

A final decision won't be reached for at least a year, and if Alphabet appeals (it says it will), the case could go on for several more. Wall Street hates uncertainty, so this has been an overhang for Alphabet stock in recent months.

All that aside, even if Alphabet were to be broken up -- and I don't believe it will -- that could unlock additional value, enriching shareholders along the way. So, the current concerns are merely noise, in my opinion.

Alphabet currently boasts a market cap of roughly $2 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of about 47% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Alphabet is expected to generate revenue of $347.4 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Alphabet would have to grow its revenue to roughly $510 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.

Wall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Alphabet of about 11% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as early as 2028. It's worth noting that Alphabet has grown its annual revenue by 368% over the past decade, so Wall Street could be lowballing its forecast.

Furthermore, Alphabet is currently selling for roughly 24 times earnings, a significant discount compared to the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500. The aforementioned uncertainty is providing a very attractive entry point for savvy investors who plan to buy and hold for the long term.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,1216

Wiz makes software that connects to cloud storage providers like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure and scans for everything it stores in the cloud, helping organizations identify and remove risks in their cloud environments. It was founded by four Israeli friends while they served in 8200, the intelligence unit of Israel's army, and most of Wiz's engineering personnel are still based in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Earlier this year, the company rejected a $23-billion acquisition bid from Google , which would have marked the tech giant's largest-ever takeover. At the time, Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport said the startup was ""flattered"" by the offer, but would remain an independent company and aim to list instead.

Speaking with CNBC at Wiz's new office space in London, Reznik said that the company has received offers from ""many people that want to get their hands on Wiz stock"" — but that, while ""very flattering,"" the firm still thinks it can do it alone by going public.

""We've already broken a few records as a private company, and we believe we can also break a few more records as an independent public company as well,"" Reznik said.

At K&I, which includes the company’s Search, Ads, Geo and Commerce products, Nick Fox will succeed Prabhakar Raghavan as head of the team, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a Thursday (Oct. 17) announcement.

Raghavan will move to the role of chief technologist at Google where he will partner with Pichai and Google leads to “provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence,” Pichai said in the announcement.

While Raghavan was leading K&I, the group launched AI Overviews in Search; added new search modalities like Circle to Search, video understanding and “shop what you see” in Lens; added artificial intelligence-driven features like immersive view and virtual try-on to Maps and Shopping; and made progress on AI-powered ad formats and streamlined campaign management, according to the announcement.

“I’m so grateful to Prabhakar for the strong foundation and leadership bench he’s built across K&I,” Pichai said in the announcement. “That includes his incredible senior leaders and Nick who is ready to hit the ground running in his new role as SVP of K&I!”

Fox, a member of Raghavan’s leadership team at K&I who will now lead that team, has demonstrated leadership across the different facets of K&I, was a pioneering leader in Ads, and launched products like Google Fi, according to the announcement.

“I frequently turn to Nick to tackle our most challenging product questions, and he consistently delivers progress with tenacity, speed and optimism,” Pichai said in the announcement.

The announcement also said that the Gemini app team led by Sissie Hsaio will join Google DeepMind under Demis Hassabis, enabling the app team and the Gemini models team to work together more closely.

It also said that the Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to Platforms & Devices so that they are closer to the products for which they are building the assistants.

Google DeepMind said Oct. 9 that it developed an AI model to predict key properties of potential drugs, aiming to accelerate pharmaceutical research.

On Tuesday (Oct. 15), Google said that it revamped its shopping platform with an experience powered by AI that will roll out across the United States in the coming weeks.

Longtime Google executive Nick Fox will replace Raghavan, who will now take on the role of chief technologist.

“Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career,” Pichai said in the announcement. “After 12 years leading teams across Google, he’ll return to his computer science roots and take on the role of Chief Technologist, Google. In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.”

Raghavan led the Gmail team in launching Smart Reply and Smart Compose, which were the email service’s first AI products. Since then, Raghavan has overseen the launch of AI Overviews and Circle to Search, along with AI features in Maps and Shopping, such as Immersive View and virtual try-on.

Pichai says Fox has “been instrumental in shaping Google’s AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar and his leadership team.”

Fox has helped launch products like Google Fi and RCS messaging.

In addition to the change in roles, Pichai announced that the Gemini app team led by Sissie Hsiao will join Google DeepMind under Demis Hassabis.

The executive writes that bringing the two teams together “will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app, make our post-training work proceed more efficiently and build on our great product momentum.”

The Google Assistant team will also become part of Google’s Platforms and Devices team so they can be closer to the products that they’re building for, Pichai says.

2024-10-17 14:19:03,DOJ antitrust win over Google will ‘very likely' kill $25B iPhone search deal with Apple: Jefferies,https://nypost.com/2024/10/17/business/doj-win-over-google-will-very-likely-kill-25b-iphone-deal-jefferies/,"Google is “very likely” to be barred from paying billions of dollars each year to Apple to ensure its search engine is enabled by default on iPhones after its stunning loss to the Justice Department in a landmark antitrust trial, according to analysts at Jefferies.

Judge Amit Mehta ruled in August that Google has an illegal monopoly over online search and specifically called out the firm’s habit of cutting checks for default status – including $20 billion to Apple in 2022 alone – as an anticompetitive tactic. The judge is expected to announce remedies by next summer.

“One very likely rectification is to ban GOOG from paying AAPL to be the exclusive search engine on iPhone,” the Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients on Wednesday.

Jefferies estimated that Apple earned $25 billion in payments from Google in fiscal 2024, which would be equivalent to 20% of the iPhone maker’s pretax profit.

Still, any impact to the bottom lines of Google and Apple is likely far off in the future. Google has already said it is appealing Mehta’s initial ruling in the search trial, while CEO Sundar Pichai has warned that the court battle will take “years” to resolve.

The final result “could take between three and eight years for the final settlement to be decided based on precedents,” the Jefferies analysts said.

“Moreover, although an exclusive deal would unlikely be allowed, the DoJ may not stop GOOG from having a revenue share agreement with AAPL, as long as it is not an exclusive deal and AAPL would allow other search engines to be available for users to choose from,” the note added.

In a filing last week, the DOJ said it is considering whether to ask Mehta to order a breakup of Google’s empire through divestment of assets such as its Chrome browser, its Google Play app store or its Android operating system.

The judge could also force Google to stop making payments to smartphone makers like Apple and carriers like AT&T, or require Google to share relevant search data, indexes and models with its rivals.

Google filed back, describing the DOJ’s remedy framework as “radical” and claiming its proposals go “far beyond the specific legal issues in this case.”

“Government overreach in a fast-moving industry may have negative unintended consequences for American innovation and America’s consumers,” Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said in a blog post. “We look forward to making our arguments in court.”",GOOGL,yes,fmp,504

The move was announced by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who said in a blog post on Thursday that Raghavan will be moving into the role of chief technologist after 12 years of leading teams across the search company. Raghavan will continue to report to Pichai in the new role, the company told CNBC in a statement.

""Prabhakar has decided it's time to make a big leap in his own career,"" Pichai wrote in the post. ""In this role, he'll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.""

The move comes as Google continues to restructure its teams to move more quickly in the artificial intelligence arms race, where it faces increased competition. The company is also dealing with several antitrust lawsuits related to its search and ads business.

Fox has long been a member of Raghavan's leadership team. He will be leading Google's Knowledge and Information division, which includes the company's search, ads and commerce products, Pichai said.

A Google employee since 2003, Fox has been vice president of product and design for the company's Assistant product in recent years. He previously worked within the company's ads business unit.

""Over the past few years, Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google's AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar,"" Pichai wrote.

Raghavan has led the knowledge and information unit since 2018. Earlier this year, he told employees to prepare for a different market reality because ""things are not like they were 15-20 years ago,"" CNBC reported.

Additionally, Pichai announced that the team working on Google's Gemini app, which includes Google's AI direct-to-consumer products, will join Google DeepMind under AI head Demis Hassabis.

""Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app,"" Pichai wrote.

The move also means the Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to the Platforms and Devices unit ""so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they're building for,"" Pichai wrote.

The Friday decision by Judge James Donato came a day after Google filed a request for an emergency stay with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Donato's decision will allow time for the appeals court to consider that request.

The decision is the latest chapter in an ongoing legal battle between game developer and publisher Epic Games and companies including Google, Apple and Samsung over making third-party app stores available to users on their platforms.

Epic has balked at fees and restrictions when it has offered games on Apple's App Store and Google Play and has sought other avenues to offer its games, including Fortnite. An early October ruling against Google would have required the company to make changes to its Play Store by Nov. 1.

In the emergency stay motion and a fact sheet published by Google, the company argued that the task of making changes to the Play Store by then is too great to accomplish without harming safety and privacy and ""puts users at risk.""

After Donato's decision, Google said in a statement, ""We're pleased with the District Court's decision to temporarily pause the implementation of dangerous remedies demanded by Epic, as the Court of Appeal considers our request to further pause the remedies while we appeal.""

A statement from Epic Games had a different take on the decision.

""The pause in the injunction is merely a procedural step to allow the Ninth Circuit time to decide Google's request to stay the injunction pending appeal,"" the statement read in part.

In the fact sheet, Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president for regulatory affairs, says that 500,000 US developers and 100 million Android users in the US could be made vulnerable by the changes Google would have needed to make to meet the original order's deadline.

""This wouldn't just hurt Google – this would have negative consequences for Android users, developers and device manufacturers who have built thriving businesses on Android,"" Mulholland wrote.

Some of the justifications in the ruling and fact sheet point to the dangers of external links within the Play Store to external app downloads, eliminating protections within billing Google says its Play service offers and rushing the process of making changes.

""The jury's verdict and the court's injunction were clear: Google's anticompetitive Play Store practices are illegal,"" Epic Games said in a statement sent to CNET.

""Google is merely fear mongering and falsely using security as a pretext to delay the changes mandated by the court. This is Google's last ditch effort to protect their control over Android and continue extracting exorbitant fees. The court's injunction must go into effect swiftly so developers and consumers can benefit from competition in the mobile ecosystem.""

Riders will be able to take advantage of the offer through November 15, and they can use the credits earned toward future robotaxi rides from now until December 31, the company said.

The pilot program is the first of its kind among autonomous vehicle operators in the U.S. It comes after Waymo found in a recent survey that 36% of San Francisco riders have used Waymo’s robotaxi service, Waymo One, to connect to other forms of transit like BART, Muni, or Caltrain.

Only a handful of stations are valid for the deal, though, mostly in south and southwest SF:

The credits will automatically be added to a rider’s account if they go to or from one of those stations — riders don’t need to prove they actually rode public transit. But for those who are considering racking up points by riding to the stations even when they’re not taking public transportation, the promotion is limited to one $3 credit per day.

Riders often use multiple modes of transportation to get from A to B, so programs like this that connect to public transportation should be more common. But unfortunately, they’re few and far between; even this program is fairly limited.

Shared micromobility is a perfect use case for connecting riders to public transportation. In September, the Seattle Department of Transportation launched a promotion to connect Lime bike and scooter share trips with public transit. That rewards program is funded by a 2016 ballot initiative called the Seattle Transit Measure.

Alphabet (GOOG 1.50%) (GOOGL 1.57%), the parent company of Google, is getting absolutely no love from the public markets right now. In fact, from a valuation standpoint, it's actually cheaper than the broader market, measured by the S&P 500.

That's an odd statement, considering that Alphabet is one of the most dominant tech companies on the market today. There's a reason for some pessimism with the stock, but is it enough to price it at a discount compared to the S&P 500?

Alphabet's stock is slightly cheaper than the S&P 500

Alphabet's stock has been fairly cheap throughout 2024, although its current state is about the cheapest it has been.

On a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, Alphabet is cheaper than the S&P 500, regardless of whether you look at trailing earnings or forward earnings. The S&P 500 currently trades for 24.7 times trailing earnings and 23.8 times forward earnings.

Essentially, the market is saying that Alphabet deserves a lower premium than the average S&P 500 constituent, which is an incredible statement.

Granted, Alphabet hasn't put itself in the best place, either. The Department of Justice indicated that it could seek to break up the company after Alphabet was found guilty of monopolistic practices. This frightened many investors, as they don't know how Alphabet would be broken up if it was forced to split up. However, this is years away, as Alphabet will challenge every part of this in court. Furthermore, when other companies are split up or divest a portion, the split often unlocks value, making the sum of the parts greater than the whole.

Although the DOJ case is one to watch, I don't think it should factor into an investor's decision to buy the stock.

Another reason Alphabet is being doubted is that some are worried the new search engines powered by generative AI could knock Alphabet from its pedestal atop the internet search market. I think there is a very low probability of this happening, as Alphabet's incredible market share (about 90%) means that a large number of people would have to change their habits. Google already added a generative AI-powered summary to the top of its search result, so in some ways, it's already evolved its platform before others could even try to usurp it.

There are many pessimistic headlines surrounding Alphabet, which led to its stock becoming so cheap. However, what remains is a company that's still doing quite well and worth investing in now. Its cheap stock price allows both investors and the company itself to get a great deal on the stock.

Because Alphabet is on the DOJ's radar, any acquisitions it wants to make are highly scrutinized. So, instead of using its cash pile to buy up other complementary companies, it buys back stock.

Similar to how an investor's money can buy more shares of a company with a cheap stock price, a company's buybacks have the same effect. Last quarter, Alphabet bought back $15 billion worth of shares, which reduced the share count by 2.6% year over year.

Alphabet's share repurchases will have a strong effect over a long time period and further amplify its earnings per share (EPS) growth. Because they reduce the denominator of this metric, they increase the output of the equation. Along with strong revenue growth (14% year over year), improved efficiencies, and share buybacks, Alphabet's EPS increased from $1.44 to $1.89 year over year in the second quarter -- a 31% rise.

Since stock price movements are highly correlated to earnings growth over the long term, Alphabet is poised to stomp the market in the future if it can keep delivering EPS growth like that. With it already trading at a discount to the broader market, it's about as no-brainer a buy as you can get right now.",GOOGL,yes,fmp,812
2024-10-17 07:46:14,Why Alphabet Could Rally 30% Before Christmas,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/why-alphabet-could-rally-30-before-christmas/,"The case for a robust end-of-year rally for shares of Alphabet Inc NASDAQ: GOOGL is building as we head into the year's final weeks. The tech giant, boasting a $2 trillion market cap, has had a somewhat bumpy ride this year. It had been enjoying a 130% rally from October 2022 into the start of this past July before giving up 20% by September. But in recent weeks, Alphabet has been climbing back up, and the bull camp has been getting louder, setting the stage for more gains before Christmas.

Headquartered in California, Alphabet is perhaps best known for its Google search and online advertising brand. But the company's innovative efforts in AI and cloud services have analysts buzzing, especially as its Q3 earnings report approaches next week. Expectations are high, and investors should be excited about the upside potential. Let's jump in and see why that's the case.

Analysts Bullish on Alphabet Heading Into the Final Quarter

Fundamentally, the business has been performing well all year. Alphabet crushed expectations in its last earnings report, and analysts are understanding bullish heading into the year's typically bumper final quarter. Over the week alone, the teams at Truist Financial, Needham, Goldman Sachs, and Scotiabank all rated the stock as a Buy.

Analysts' arguments were consistent. Each is bullish on Alphabet's growth story, especially as it continues to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its product offerings, including recent AI upgrades to Google Shopping.

The team over at Truist went so far as to name it one of their top picks for the remainder of the year based on Alphabet's robust Q3 outlook and the bullish momentum currently being seen across the broader market. Their refreshed price target of $220 is close to the street-high target of $240. Considering Alphabet shares were trading around the 165% market during Wednesday's session, this is pointing towards a targeted upside of more than 30% in the coming weeks. Needless to say, it would also mean Alphabet shares would have soared to new highs.

Moreover, the broader market is contributing to a risk-on environment. The S&P 500 is hitting fresh all-time highs, and with the Federal Reserve likely to cut interest rates soon, tech stocks like Alphabet are poised to benefit. Investors are flocking back to growth names, seeking companies with the potential for significant gains—and Alphabet fits that bill.

Some of the more bearish concerns are worth noting, especially those around the ongoing antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice. However, CEO Sundar Pichai recently brushed these aside and made it clear he's confident in the company's long-term outlook.

In a recent interview, Pichai acknowledged the legal challenges but emphasized Alphabet's resilience, noting that ""we will appeal, and this process will likely take many years. I'm confident, given that we are focused on innovating in the use of technology, we'll do well in the long run.""

Investors should look for the stock to continue building momentum as earnings approach. With analysts raising their price targets and broader market conditions favoring tech stocks in general, Alphabet's outlook is undeniably bullish. This stance is backed up by the stock's technical indicators, which are also on the side of the bulls.

The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements, is sitting at a reasonably neutral 53. A reading between 30 and 70 typically signals healthy price action without being overbought or oversold, and so, at 53, Alphabet has a ton of room to continue rallying from here. Don't be surprised if it's sitting at fresh all-time highs, well above $200, by the time markets close for the holidays.

2024-10-25T09:00:00+00:00,Google reports third-quarter earnings next week. Here's what to expect,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/google-reports-third-quarter-earnings-090000550.html,"Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet is set to report third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, after beating second-quarter earnings expectations on artificial intelligence momentum.

The tech giant is expected to report revenues of around $86.4 billion for the third quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Google’s U.S. revenues are expected to be $40.6 billion, and its “rest of the world” revenues are expected at $45 billion. The company is expected to report earnings per share, or EPS, of $1.84, according to FactSet.

In the second quarter, Google reported revenues of nearly $85 billion, outdoing Wall Street’s expectations by around $640 million. Google’s revenue was up 14% year over year, and its Cloud division surpassed $10 billion in quarterly revenues for the first time, Google president Ruth Porat said. Google Cloud also exceeded $1 billion in operating profit for the first time.

“Our strong performance this quarter highlights ongoing strength in Search and momentum in Cloud,” Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement at the time. “We are innovating at every layer of the AI stack. Our longstanding infrastructure leadership and in-house research teams position us well as technology evolves and as we pursue the many opportunities ahead.”

In recent months, Google has reportedly made progress on software for AI models that resembles humanlike reasoning abilities. The company has long focused on “reasoning” capabilities in large language models (LLMs), including with its work on chain-of-thought prompting.

With this technique, which people told Bloomberg Google is using, LLMs can solve multistep problems using a “series of intermediate reasoning steps,” similar to the way a human would. OpenAI unveiled its “reasoning” model series, OpenAI o1, in September.

Google is also working on improving its Gemini chatbot’s “reasoning” abilities. In July, Google made its fastest, most cost-efficient model, 1.5 Flash, available in the unpaid version of Gemini.

Shares of Google are up around 18% so far this year.

2024-10-25T00:00:00+00:00,"1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Soars 200%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/25/1-ai-stock-to-buy-before-it-soars-200-wall-street/,"Trefis analysts think Alphabet could be a $500 stock by the end of the decade.

Trefis analysts think Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%) could be a $500 stock by 2030. That forecast comes from an opinion piece published in Forbes in October, and it implies a little over 200% upside from the current share price of $162. Should it prove accurate, shareholders would see annual returns of approximately 20% over the next six-plus years.

Wall Street also expects Alphabet to move higher in the near-term. Of the 68 analysts that follow the company, the lowest 12-month price target of $170 per share implies 5% upside. In other words, not one analyst thinks the stock will decline over the next 12 months. Of course, there is no such thing as a guarantee where the stock market is concerned, but the optimism is nevertheless noteworthy.

Here's what investors should know about Alphabet, and what it might take for its share price to hit $500 by 2030.

Alphabet should benefit as the digital advertising and cloud computing markets expand

The investment thesis for Alphabet hinges on its strength in advertising and cloud computing, two markets projected to grow quickly. Specifically, eMarketer expects digital ad spending to increase at 10% annually through 2028, and IDC estimates public cloud spending will grow at 19% annually during the same period, led by high demand in artificial intelligence (AI) platform services.

Alphabet is the market leader in digital advertising with 27.4% revenue share. That figure is forecast to decline by half-percentage point next year as Amazon and other competitors gain ground. But Alphabet has a material advantage in that it owns six products with over 2 billion monthly users, including Google Search and YouTube. Those popular platforms engage consumers and create data that supports ad targeting.

Importantly, Alphabet is leaning on its AI expertise to defend its leadership in digital advertising. CEO Sundar Pichai says generative AI overviews on Google Search are boosting usage and improving user satisfaction, especially among people aged 18 to 24. The company also debuted over 30 new AI features for its ad tech software last quarter to streamline workflows and improve campaign outcomes.

Finally, Alphabet operates the third-largest public cloud in Google Cloud Platform. While the company trails Amazon and Microsoft by a wide margin, strength in AI infrastructure and large language models helped it gain a percentage point of market share over the past year. ""Google's Gemini combines a world-class model with enterprise cloud services,"" according to Forrester Research.

Alphabet has an overlooked opportunity in its autonomous ride-hailing business Waymo

Trefis analysts highlighted autonomous driving subsidiary Waymo as a major reason why Alphabet could be a $500 stock by 2030. Investors often overlook that part of the business, but the robotaxi market is expected to increase at 67% annually through 2030, according to Straits Research. And Alphabet is well positioned to be a major winner.

Waymo was the first company to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service, and it now provides more than 100,000 rides per week across Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. To add, Waymo has partnered with Uber to bring its ride-hailing platform to Atlanta and Austin in 2025. Analysts at Bank of America estimate Waymo's revenue could reach $75 million this year, an inconsequential sum, but that figure could grow rapidly in the future.

Anecdotally, I recently visited San Francisco and had the chance to use the Waymo app. The experience was seamless and the technology was impressive. The Waymo vehicle was appropriately cautious as it navigated the congested city streets lined with pedestrians, but it was also assertive when necessary. I have never been more certain that robotaxis are the future.

What it would take for Alphabet to be a $500 stock by 2030

Investors should be aware of the regulatory risk. A federal judge ruled in August that Google had engaged in illegal practices to preserve its search monopoly. The Justice Department has suggested remedies ranging from restrictions to a breakup. But the judge will not issue a final decision until August 2025, and appeals could drag the process out for years.

Importantly, while the Justice Department has proposed a forced divestiture of the Chrome browser or Android operating system, some legal experts believe the final solution will be less severe. They say the most likely outcome is that Alphabet will be prohibited from paying companies like Apple for default search engine placement, according to CNBC.

With that in mind, Wall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase at 15.6% annually through 2027, which makes the current valuation of 23 times earnings look reasonable. If we assume the company's earnings increase at the same pace through 2030, Alphabet's share price would reach $500 if the stock traded at 30.7 times earnings. That would be a material premium to its current valuation, which seems unlikely six-plus years down the road.

Having said that, Alphabet's earnings could grow more quickly than analysts anticipate if Waymo becomes a meaningful source of profit. In that context, a $500 share price is not out of the question. Either way, patient investors should feel confident about buying a small position in this stock today.",GOOGL,yes,eod,1089
2024-10-24T00:00:00+00:00,How Much Does Google Make in Ad Revenue?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/24/how-much-does-google-make-in-ad-revenue/,"Alphabet dominates the digital ad market. Take a look at the numbers.

Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%) is the world's biggest advertising company. It established itself as the industry leader largely due to the strength of Google Search, which has a monopoly-like market share for online search. That business, more than any other under Alphabet's umbrella, has helped give the company a valuation of around $2 trillion.

Digital advertising has proven to be a highly lucrative business for Alphabet, and it's driven superior operating margins at the company for much of its history. After all, Google's search page is among the most valuable digital real estate properties on the internet. It's the first place most users go when they want to get new information about a health concern, a trip they're planning, or a restaurant they're interested in, among other things.

The chart below shows how Google compares to its closest rivals in search around the world.

As you can see, not only is Alphabet light years ahead of Microsoft, Baidu, and Yandex, but there's more to Alphabet's ad business than just search. So where does Alphabet's ad revenue come from?

Of the $237.9 billion Alphabet generated in ad revenue in 2023, $175.0 billion, or 73.6%, came from Google Search. The company's trademark search engine remains the primary driver of both revenue and profits at the tech giant.

After Search, it brought in $31.5 billion, or 13.3%, via YouTube, its leading video-sharing platform. Google Network, its third-party ads that are served on partner websites, brought in $31.3 billion, about the same percentage as YouTube.

Google's ad business is still delivering strong growth, up 11% year over year in the second quarter. And based on its dominance of the space and the consistent need of businesses to advertise on Google, it's likely to continue to grow.

Expect Alphabet to maintain its leadership in the digital advertising industry for years to come.",GOOGL,yes,eod,418
2024-10-24T00:00:00+00:00,VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (MOAT): How to Buy,https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-moat-etf/,"Today, retail investors have the opportunity to emulate this approach through various exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (MOAT -0.5%) standing out as a notable example. In this article, we'll explore how this ETF selects its stocks, review its holdings, highlight its historical performance, and go over other essential details that investors should consider before making an investment decision.

What is it? What is the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF? VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF is a passive ETF that replicates the performance and holdings of the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index. This benchmark selects its holdings through a process that starts by identifying companies from the broader Morningstar US Market Index. These companies must have been assigned a ""wide"" economic moat rating and a ""fair value"" estimate by Morningstar analysts. From this group, the smallest 3% by float-adjusted market capitalization are removed. The remaining companies are then ranked based on their ""fair value ratios."" The ETF constructs its portfolio by selecting as many as 40 companies, which are divided into two sub-portfolios. Within each sub-portfolio, the stocks are equally weighted and must adhere to sector constraints. It undergoes a reconstitution semi-annually on a staggered quarterly schedule -- one sub-portfolio is reconstituted in December and the other in June. Each sub-portfolio is also rebalanced to maintain equal weighting among the stocks. This careful and systematic approach ensures that the ETF consistently aligns with its index criteria, focusing on companies that sustain strong competitive advantages and also trade at fair valuations.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to buy ETFs like the Wide Moat: 1. Open Your Brokerage App: Start by logging into your brokerage account. If you don't have one, you'll need to set one up and fund it. 2. Search for the Ticker: Enter ""MOAT,"" the ticker symbol for the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF, into the search bar. 3. Select the Stock: Make sure you select the stock option rather than options or other securities associated with the ETF. 4. Enter the Number of Shares: Decide how many shares you want to buy and enter that number in the ""quantity"" field. Market Order: Choose this if you want to buy the ETF at the current market price. Your order will execute at the best available price in the market. Limit Order: Use this to specify the maximum price you are willing to pay per share. Your order will only execute if it can be bought at your specified price or lower. 6. Review Your Order: Double-check the details of your order to ensure everything is correct. 7. Confirm and Place Your Order: Once you confirm the details, submit your order. The cash will be debited from your account, and the shares of the ETF will be credited.

As of October 2024, the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (MOAT) included 55 holdings, all of which are equally weighted at each rebalancing period. At any given time, the top holdings within this ETF tend to be the companies that have outperformed between rebalancing and reconstitution cycles. Here are some of the notable wide moat stocks currently included in its holdings:
• Salesforce ( ): Leads in cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, bolstering its competitive moat through innovation and high customer switching costs.
• Allegion Plc ( ): A leading provider of security products, with significant customer retention and barriers to new competitors.
• Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc ( ): America's largest military shipbuilder, enjoying a secure market position due to the specialized demand and limited competition.
• Equifax ( ): Operates in a near-duopoly in credit reporting, leveraging extensive data assets that present a durable moat.
• Alphabet ( )( ): Holds a dominant stance in internet search and digital advertising, benefiting from vast network effects and continuous innovation.
• Amazon ( ): A giant in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon utilizes its size, brand, and extensive infrastructure to maintain its competitive edge.

Should I invest in the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF? Investing in VanEck's ETF is ideal for long-term ETF investors looking to complement their core investment holdings with a ""satellite"" strategy. This approach acknowledges its concentrated nature, focusing on companies identified as having wide economic moats and fair market values. The ETF is characterized by a high active share, which means its holdings diverge significantly from the broader market indexes such as the S&P 500. Active share is a metric used to compare the holdings of a portfolio against a benchmark; a high active share indicates that the fund's holdings are quite different from the index, potentially offering unique advantages and risks. Given its distinctive strategy, it might perform differently from your main market exposure, making it a valuable tool for seeking excess returns through a focused bet on high-quality companies. For investors who already target wide-moat stocks, the Wide Moat ETF also offers a straightforward and efficient way to maintain exposure to these companies without the need for frequent manual trading or individual stock selection.

What is the ETF's expense ratio? The expense ratio for the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF is 0.47%. This includes a management fee of 0.45% and other expenses totaling 0.02%. For a $10,000 investment in VanEck's ETF, this translates to an annual cost of about $47. It's important to note that this expense ratio isn't paid directly out of your pocket; rather, it's subtracted from the ETF's returns on a daily basis, affecting the overall performance of your investment indirectly.

This ETF offers investors a potential avenue to outperform the broader market, assuming you trust Morningstar's methodology for identifying fairly valued companies with sustainable competitive advantages. Over the past decade, the Wide Moat ETF has outperformed the S&P 500, although it has lagged behind in shorter time frames such as 1, 3, and 5 years. Other factors include its relatively high expense ratio of 0.47%, possibly because of its portfolio turnover. As an investor, it's crucial to be comfortable with its concentrated portfolio, typically holding between 40 and 55 stocks, and to prepare for a performance that can diverge significantly from the broader market both on a daily and longer-term basis.",GOOGL,yes,eod,1325

2024-10-22T00:00:00+00:00,1 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That's a No-Brainer Buy,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/22/1-top-ai-stock-thats-no-brainer-buy/,"This company was a longtime mover and shaker in AI (and may still be a leader).

When it comes to stocks driven by the increased interest in all things having to do with artificial intelligence (AI), investors have gravitated to Nvidia. In a sense, this is understandable, as Nvidia's vision brought about an early lead in the AI chip industry amid the sudden demand for generative AI capabilities.

The problem with this focus is that the AI industry extends far beyond Nvidia. That might lead one to overlook opportunities that could potentially match or even outshine that stock going forward. Given the dynamics of the AI industry, it might be time for investors to pivot to AI leaders like Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%).

AI investors should stay aware of Alphabet as it is one of the original AI stocks. The company first began utilizing AI back in 2001 when it began applying spell checks to Google searches. Its AI technology advanced from that point, and for years, most industry analysts saw it as an AI leader.

However, that changed in the spring of 2023 when OpenAI released its latest version of the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. That company partnered with rival Microsoft and ran its servers on Nvidia chips, appearing to leave Alphabet and its companies out of the mix.

Despite the perception the Microsoft/OpenAI deal created, it is unclear whether Alphabet is ""behind"" in AI. The company responded quickly by launching its own updated generative AI chatbot Bard in the spring of 2023, following that up with Google Gemini in December of that year.

Moreover, it has taken a different approach to AI, leveraging its Google Research and Google DeepMind teams to emphasize the development of every layer of the AI stack. It focuses heavily on the ethics and safety issues that may come with AI. Additionally, it has developed one of the more popular AI libraries with TensorFlow, a free, open-source library for machine learning. That perspective could help Alphabet stand out as the awareness of AI's potential grows.

Investors should also remember that the Google parent holds almost $101 billion in liquidity. This gives it tremendous resources to succeed with AI. Furthermore, in the first half of the year alone, Alphabet generated more than $30 billion in free cash flow, bringing added flexibility to help the company address any technical gaps.

Indeed, the financials show it is not as bad off as some investors might assume. In the first half of 2024, Alphabet's revenue grew 14% yearly to $165 billion. Also, since the company held cost and expense growth to just 7%, net income rose to $47 billion during that period, a 42% yearly increase.

Also, one number in the financials highlights the importance of AI in the company's growth trajectory -- namely, the performance of Google Cloud. It accounted for $20 billion of the company's revenue in the first two quarters of 2024 and experienced a 28% annual increase, roughly double Alphabet's overall revenue growth rate during that time.

Moreover, while Google Cloud lags Amazon and Microsoft in that industry, its market positioning shows it plays a critical role in the cloud industry, emphasizing its need to succeed in AI.

To that end, many investors appear to still hold faith in Alphabet stock, which is up by almost 20% over the last year. Additionally, a pullback in the stock price has left it with a P/E ratio of 24, the lowest among its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers. That lower valuation could lead investors back into the stock as more come to appreciate the company's competitive position in the AI industry.

Given the company's position and stock performance, it is likely time for investors to come back to Alphabet stock. Indeed, some of its competitors have made significant strides in AI, leaving many to wonder whether the Google parent is still a market leader in this technology.

However, the company was quick to respond with its own generative AI offerings. Also, since the cloud plays a critical role in implementing AI, Google Cloud has helped invigorate the company's growth.

Ultimately, it is likely too early to write off Alphabet in the AI race. With a rising stock price and a low valuation among its mega-tech competitors, investors should consider following the Google parent more closely.",GOOGL,yes,eod,875
2024-10-21T19:00:15+00:00,Qualcomm reveals AI smartphone chip as industry leans into AI phones,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-reveals-ai-smartphone-chip-as-industry-leans-into-ai-phones-190015353.html,"The smartphone industry is banking on AI to reaccelerate device sales after years of slowing growth. But to do that, it’ll have to give consumers a reason to pony up for new phones more often.

Qualcomm (QCOM) is aiming for its latest smartphone chips to do just that, adding a number of new on-board AI capabilities it says will allow you to do things like virtually adjust the lighting in your video calls in real-time and allow your device to recognize real-world objects without having to access the web.

The Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s latest top-of-the-line mobile processor and includes improved performance and power efficiency thanks to the company’s use of what it calls Prime Cores, which are designed for high-end applications, and Performance Cores, for more casual tasks.

Qualcomm says the chips will make their way into smartphones from companies including Samsung, Xiaomi, ASUS, OnePlus, Honor, Oppo, and more in the coming weeks.

The chipmaker is promising some big performance gains from the Snapdragon 8 Elite, saying its central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) should save 44% and 40% more energy than its predecessor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen. 3, which Samsung used in its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones.

But the chip’s biggest feature is its ability to power onboard AI functions. Qualcomm says the chip will allow for things like erasing unwanted objects in videos, rather than just photos, without having to upload your movie to the cloud for processing. Instead, your phone will be able to simply remove that person who walked into the background of your shot.

The company also says OEM partners can use the NPU to expand photos beyond their borders by, for instance, increasing the background of a shot, and use the camera to interact with the world around you. For instance, you’ll be able to point your phone at an object and ask the onboard voice assistant about objects in your shot without the need to connect to the web.

Qualcomm unveiled its first-generation Snapdragon X Elite in late 2023, and Microsoft (MSFT) eventually chose the processors for its Surface line of laptops and processors, debuting the new PCs in May this year.

Onboard AI is the major common denominator between the two generations of chips. Qualcomm is working to ensure that users don’t need an internet connection to use generative AI apps and services, which could prove to be a major differentiator for new smartphones and PCs versus their predecessors.

Both the PC and smartphone industries believe AI will be the next big feature to get consumers to upgrade their devices to newer systems in the coming months and years. Still, outfitting devices with the ability to run AI apps isn’t going to get the vast majority of customers interested in spending a few hundred dollars on a new laptop or smartphone. The only thing that will do that are intriguing new apps that take advantage of AI.

Sure, more intelligent digital assistants are helpful, and improving photo and video capabilities is impressive, but there’s still no single killer app or app category that’s got people talking about wanting an AI device. My own friends and family are certainly interested in the marketing around AI products, but none of them, outside of a few early adopters and people who need the latest and greatest devices, are interested in paying up for AI just yet. That said, it’s still early in the consumer AI lifecycle, meaning there’s plenty of time for a slick new app that takes advantage of AI to come along. And when it does, we’ll finally get a sense of the appetite for AI-powered hardware. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

I Like You.',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nba-icon-shaquille-oneal-says-151523020.html,"Shaquille O’Neal, the former NBA superstar, has seen his fair share of investments. Still, one of his most notable financial decisions came through babysitting – something he didn't expect to be doing. In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, O’Neal detailed how this casual encounter led to one of his most lucrative opportunities. However, not all of his investments began as favorably.

• ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share

Discussing his ventures, O’Neal recounted what he considers his “worst investment ever.” He had a chance to partner with Starbucks when its CEO, Howard Schultz, proposed expanding into African American communities. O’Neal explained his initial skepticism: “So, me growing up, I’d never seen Black people drink coffee. So I look to the owner of Starbucks and say, ‘it’s not going to work. Black people don’t drink coffee.’” This decision, he admits, did not age well, humorously noting, “So now, every time I go to Starbucks, I see Black people drinking coffee, I’m like–”

Trending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.

Passing on Starbucks may have been a huge mistake, but he still got in early on one of the most powerful tech companies ever. While at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles around 1993 or 1994, he babysat a couple of children whose father was in a meeting. After the meeting, the father, impressed with Shaq’s rapport with his children, offered him an investment opportunity in a then-little-known startup named Google. “You’re good with kids. I like you. I’m going to bring you in on this investment,” the father said. He described the future of Google, envisioning a world where “you’re going to be able to type on your phone, search engine, this, do this, boom, boom, boom. You should invest.”

Shaq took the advice and the rest is history. “I invested. And then, a couple of years later, I got a really big return,” he shared with DeGeneres. The exact amount Shaq invested in Google was never disclosed.",GOOGL,yes,eod,572

2024-10-21T09:30:44+00:00,Microsoft launches Copilot AI features as investors look for signs artificial intelligence is paying off,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-launches-copilot-ai-features-as-investors-look-for-signs-artificial-intelligence-is-paying-off-093044133.html,"Microsoft (MSFT) is continuing to find ways to monetize its massive investments in artificial intelligence with an increasing array of software offerings for enterprises and consumers. The company’s latest effort is what it calls autonomous agents and comes as Wall Street prepares to scrutinize tech companies’ AI spending and growth.

During its AI Tour event in London on Monday, which included keynotes by CEO Satya Nadella and chief marketing officer of Copilot at Work Jared Spataro, Microsoft announced that the new software will be available for public preview next month.

Essentially custom-built AI apps that can handle specific tasks for enterprise workers, autonomous agents are meant to free up employees’ time to handle other projects. Microsoft pointed to companies like McKinsey & Company and the UK-based Pets at Home that have used their own agents to cut down on time-consuming work including data entry and processing client proposals.

Users can build their own autonomous agents in Copilot Studio using what Microsoft refers to as low-code or no-code instructions. Basically, you give the autonomous agent a purpose, like sorting through incoming email requests for service.

From there, you tell the agent, in natural language with no coding, what to do with the email, the kind of information it needs to pull out of the message, and what to do if any data is missing or otherwise unavailable. You can then attach different files and documents outlining how to handle customer data and then set the agent to work.

Microsoft also included the ability for workers to step in and check the agent’s work to ensure its accuracy, as well as deal with any potential hallucinations, or errors introduced by the AI itself.

Microsoft’s autonomous agents are part of a broader effort to take advantage of and get a return on its investments in AI, including its team-up with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

In its most recent quarterly report, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the company spent $19 billion on capital expenditures, including finance leases, the majority of which came from AI and cloud-related needs. In total, Microsoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures through its fiscal 2024. That’s up from $31.9 billion in 2023, and $29.2 billion in 2022.

The company says 2.1 million users currently engage with Copilot via its Microsoft business applications each month, a number the tech giant is keen on raising. The company is banking heavily on its AI-powered Copilot platform to generate revenue from businesses looking to take advantage of the software to improve overall worker efficiency.",GOOGL,yes,eod,508
2024-10-21T09:30:00+00:00,Inside Microsoft's AI strategy: Compete with everybody on everything,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/inside-microsofts-ai-strategy-compete-093000944.html,"LOS ANGELES — At a Microsoft (MSFT) event here earlier this month, attendees sipped drinks and sampled hors d’oeuvres as Kendrick Lamar pulsed through the speakers. They meandered between rows of laptops, each demonstrating the latest capabilities of the company’s flagship AI product, Copilot. True to the city’s reputation, many of those present were influencers, filming their interactions with the technology for their followers.



Yet even these arbiters of digital trends seemed genuinely intrigued. The artificial intelligence updates on display marked a significant shift from Microsoft’s previous focus on business productivity, with features that appealed to a broader audience — including tech-savvy influencers.



The tech giant’s latest offerings represent a significant leap forward in personalized AI, integrating voice and vision features that promise to transform how users interact with the technology. Among the additions to Microsoft’s Copilot are a visual recognition tool, chatty conversational abilities, and a virtual news anchor.



Microsoft isn’t done with Copilot announcements, with even more updates announced at a London event Monday morning. The ambitious moves position Copilot as a direct challenger to AI products made by Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Adobe (ADBE), and even OpenAI, one of the company’s partners and the maker of ChatGPT.

By combining advanced language processing with visual and auditory capabilities, and envisioning how AI could help people throughout their day, Microsoft is aiming to become the go-to AI platform for both work and personal life.

The Copilot revamp is the first major initiative led by Mustafa Suleyman since his appointment as CEO of Microsoft AI. Suleyman, a co-founder of DeepMind and the startup Inflection AI, joined Microsoft earlier this year when the tech giant acquired Inflection.



“At Microsoft AI, we are creating an AI companion for everyone,” Suleyman wrote in a blog post.



Carolina Milanesi, the president and principal analyst at Creative Strategies, went to an accompanying Copilot launch event in New York and described it as Suleyman’s coming out party.



“It was the first time Microsoft talked about the consumer,” she said in an interview. Milanesi noted that some of the demos were running on iOS or Android devices, signaling Microsoft’s intent to reach users across all platforms.



Milanesi said it was also the first time she thought that Microsoft could appeal to the non-business side of people’s lives beyond search and gaming. The focus on the updated Copilot app, one of the primary ways to interact with the tech, is an especially important move, given how much time people spend on their phones. By launching it for iOS and Android, Microsoft has beaten both Apple and Samsung to the punch in bringing a comprehensive AI assistant to smartphones.



“Consumers are still not quite sure what the return on investment is,” Milanesi said of using phones with AI capabilities. “Having an app that delivers value to you is going to be easier to see versus when it’s embedded across the device.”



The strategy gives Microsoft a window of opportunity to establish itself in the mobile AI space before Apple rolls out its Apple Intelligence or Samsung embraces solutions like Google’s Gemini. Whether Copilot will live up to other offerings, Microsoft’s strategy is clear.



“Whatever they sell,” Milanesi said, “generative AI is part of it and will drive a differentiation in what they’re selling.”



Not long after investing a reported $13 billion in OpenAI last year, Microsoft announced AI assistants it calls Copilots, which plug into its biggest software products including Word, Excel and PowerPoint — all powered at least in part by ChatGPT. The Copilots are meant to make work easier by doing things like generating slide decks or creating notes from a Zoom meeting.

But Microsoft’s latest Copilot update reaches far beyond the workday, challenging a wide array of existing tools. Taking cues from OpenAI’s recent voice innovations in ChatGPT, Microsoft has given its AI assistant a human-like conversational ability. Users can now choose from four distinct voices and engage in natural, flowing dialogues with Copilot. The AI allows for mid-conversation interruptions and follow-up questions, mirroring the back-and-forth of chatting with a real person.



Even Microsoft’s Paint app, once the lowliest of visual editing tools, now comes with generative AI abilities that compete with Adobe’s Firefly. A feature in the app called Image Creator lets users generate images from any text description. Doodlers can sketch out a basic scene and have Paint make it more elaborate and realistic, using a creativity slider to adjust the output.



Updates to Microsoft’s Edge browser, which has Copilot built-in, can now summarize page contents in Bing searches, a shot across the bow at Google’s rocky foray into AI-infused search.



Other updates also take on Google. Copilot Daily creates audio summaries of the news that rival NotebookLM, a Google AI product that can take text and generate a podcast in minutes.



But at the heart of Copilot’s overhaul is Microsoft’s ambitious foray into visual AI: Copilot Vision. This feature gives the assistant the ability to comprehend and analyze the content of web pages in real-time, effectively allowing it to “see” alongside the user. By integrating this visual acuity with its enhanced voice capabilities, Copilot can now engage in nuanced, context-aware dialogue about on-screen content — be it text, images, or multimedia. So far, only a select number of paid subscribers have access to this service.



Even with all these announcements, Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, downgraded his rating on Microsoft stock from “Buy” to “Neutral.”



“Our perspective on Microsoft is still very positive,” Luria said in an interview. “They’re doing a lot to provide both enterprise and consumers with AI tools. Our recent downgrade is predicated more on the fact that we think that in many regards, Amazon (AMZN) and Google have caught up, and in some regards they’re even in the lead.”



Luria said that while Microsoft is ahead of the curve for many AI offerings, AI chip development, a very time-consuming process, is a key area where Microsoft lags its rivals. Google started work on its chips over a decade ago, with Amazon following a few years later.



“Microsoft was a little late to the party in realizing that they can’t just depend on Nvidia (NVDA),” Luria said, referring to the AI chipmaking behemoth. “So they’ve only had a couple of years of development into their products.”



D.A. Davidson has found that while Amazon and Google have extensively deployed their own custom chips across their data centers, Microsoft has not achieved the same level of broad deployment.



“They started their chip development later than Amazon and Google,” Luria said. “But apart from that, they’re doing what they need to do.”



Microsoft rode the wave of AI enthusiasm in 2023, with its stock surging almost 57% last year. But 2024 has proven to be a more challenging landscape for the tech giant. Microsoft stock has risen about 12% so far this year, trailing most of its peers and even the broader S&P 500 index.

While Microsoft has not yet disclosed specific revenue figures for generative AI products such as Copilot, the company has provided some insight into AI’s impact on its business. During its last quarterly earnings call in July, Microsoft said its cloud service saw 29% year-over-year revenue growth, with 8 percentage points of that growth attributable to AI services.



If it becomes a seamless part of people’s lives, Microsoft’s Copilot could unlock new revenue streams and solidify the company’s position in both consumer and enterprise markets. The challenge lies in creating AI tools that are not just innovative, but indispensable to users’ daily lives and work processes.



“Our task is to ensure AI always enriches people’s lives and strengthens our bonds with others, while supporting our uniqueness and endlessly complex humanity,” Suleyman wrote. “This is a new era of technology that doesn’t just ‘solve problems,’ it’s there to support you, teach you and help you.”

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI news investors should not miss.

According to Ark Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence breakthroughs are expected to increase the share of the global equity market associated with disruptive innovation from 16% to 60% by 2030. With inflation transitioning to deflation in several sectors, the firm believes that five innovation platforms, namely robotics, energy storage, AI, blockchain, and multi-OMIC (biological analysis) sequencing will be profoundly impacting macroeconomic metrics over the next few years.

One of the firm's ETFs with the investment theme of next-generation internet outperformed broad-based global equity indices in the third quarter, benefiting from its holdings in companies involved in innovative technologies. The year-to-date performance of the fund is 16.81%, outperforming its category by 1.59 percentage points year-to-date.

In light of this trend, joining CNBC’s “The Exchange”, technology reporter Kate Rooney revealed how Wall Street is trying to cash in on the AI craze using AI itself. According to Rooney, the new world of generative AI is starting an “arms race for hedge funds”. Modern versions of AI today are better than human traders in ways more than one. They learn from mistakes and get smarter along the way, and they ultimately require minimal human intervention. Combining this with the rise of OpenAI and Anthropic, these “off-the-shelf” models tend to be cheaper.

Moreover, while human traders may be capable, they often succumb to emotions and tend to make mistakes. This is why Intelligent Alpha CEO Doug Clinton believes that a “lack of emotion” is actually the edge or “superpower” of AI. That said, the program revealed how hedge funds are now looking into AI to “get ahead of the markets”, where their use of AI will ultimately help them improve decision-making in the field. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised significant capital along the way, ultimately need enterprise clients to scale, and Wall Street is an ideal fit due to its reliance on data and analysis.

Intelligent Alpha has launched a first-of-its-kind ETF named after famed stock trader Jesse Livermore. The ETF uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini to construct a global equity portfolio. As per Clinton, firms that get on board with AI could gain an edge with a price tag of millions of dollars. “What it does is it adds some intelligence to indexes, which are just definitionally sort of a set of rules that can’t be smart. And they also take that emotion out of the active side where human beings are still making decisions, but we get caught up. You know, we make mistakes and sometimes those compound. And so I think by fixing those two issues, AI has the potential to really capture a lot of value in terms of assets flowing to these new AI-powered funds.” - Intelligent Alpha CEO Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.

Analysts at the Switzerland-based investment bank UBS believe artificial intelligence (AI) will be ""the most profound innovation and one of the largest investment opportunities in human history."" But that grandiose phrasing fails to capture how transformative the technology could be.

Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, estimates humankind could achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) by 2030, meaning a level of superintelligence that would help scientists ""cure most diseases within the next decade or two."" Hassabis also believes AGI could solve problems related to energy production and climate change. And he is not alone in making bold predictions.

Dario Amodei, CEO of AI start-up Anthropic, says the emergence superintelligence could lead to the eradication of most infectious diseases, the elimination of most cancers, and the mitigation of climate change. Amodei also thinks AGI will support a doubling in the human lifespan, and he believes those changes could happen within a decade.

Even if those timelines are overly optimistic, companies that provide AI infrastructure and software services could create substantial wealth for investors in the coming years. Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%) and Datadog (DDOG 2.19%) fit that profile. The stocks over the last five years returned 160% and 305%, respectively, and the AI boom could lead to an even stronger performance over the next five years.

Here's what investors should know.

Alphabet subsidiary Google was recently recognized by Forrester Research as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure solutions and foundational large language models. The company is using its AI expertise to reinforce its leadership in digital advertising, and strengthen its position in cloud infrastructure and platform services (CIPS).

For instance, generative AI overviews are increasing usage and improving satisfaction with Google Search, especially among young adults aged 18 to 24, according to CEO Sundar Pichai. Similarly, the company has debuted AI-driven profit optimization tools for advertisers, as well as generative AI tools that automate media content creation and advertising campaign construction.

Additionally, Google Cloud Platform added over 500 updates last year for its machine learning platform Vertex AI, according to consultancy Gartner. Vertex lets users customize pretrained models like Gemini and build AI applications. Google still trails Amazon and Microsoft by a wide margin in CIPS, but its market share increased by a percentage point over the past year, according to Synergy Research.

Alphabet reported strong financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 14% to $84.7 billion due to momentum in the cloud computing segement, and modest growth in the advertising segement. Meanwhile, GAAP net income jumped 31% to $1.89 per diluted share as the company continued to prioritize disciplined cost control.

Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 23 times earnings look quite reasonable. Patient investors should feel confident buying a small position in this AI stock today.

Datadog provides observability software that helps businesses monitor, analyze, and fix performance issues across their IT infrastructure and applications. Its portfolio features artificial intelligence features that identify anomalies, surface insights, and automate root cause analysis. Consultancy Gartner has recognized Datadog as a leader in observability software for four consecutive years, and Forrester Research has recognized its leadership in AI for IT operations.

Observability software becomes more important as computing environments grow more complex. So, the proliferation of AI systems should be a major tailwind for Datadog, and it's leaning into that opportunity with LLM Observability, a performance monitoring product for large language models (LLMs). The company also introduced a natural language interface called Bits AI that leans on generative AI to accelerate incident investigation and response.

Datadog reported strong financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 27% to $645 million as its customer base expanded and existing customers spent more money. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income increased 48% to $0.43 per diluted share. Management also raised its full-year guidance, such that sales are projected to increase 23% in 2024.

Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Datadog's revenue to increase at 23% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 20 times sales look tolerable, and it represents a discount to the three-year average of 23.7 times sales. To be clear, the stock is not cheap at its current price, but patient investors should still consider buying a few shares. Datadog has a strong position in a software market that will become more critical as AI deployments increase.

Importantly, there is a reasonably good chance the stock will pull back at some point in the future, maybe by more than 20%. Investors should be comfortable with that possibility before purchasing shares today, and they should be willing to buy the dip if such a pullback occurs.",GOOGL,yes,eod,1028

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024.

The tech sector has been showing positive performance amid market concerns, driven by improved earnings estimates and substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Approximately 40% of operating cash flow is currently allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will begin to yield returns. The strong profit margins of mega-cap stocks, averaging over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors, suggest continued capital inflows into tech companies demonstrating earnings strength. While some consolidation and growth slowdown may occur, there is confidence that investor sentiment will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.

As sentiments shift regarding major tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining positive momentum in the market. There was a conversation regarding this, covered a few days back in our article about the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In, where Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, discussed the tech sector’s mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Here’s an excerpt from his sentiment:

Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on October 17 and highlighted that there’s a likelihood that the markets could move into choppier territory. Katie Stockton characterized her stance as neutral regarding the indices despite the strength of the trend and the participation of most stocks on the upside. She noted that while short-term momentum is currently positive, particularly behind major indices, there are concerns about potential problems if key players like NVIDIA falter. She highlighted that sentiment appears overly bullish or greedy, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index reaching an extreme level of 5%. This situation makes it challenging for the market to sustain overbought conditions, which are prevalent across various timeframes.

Stockton anticipates a pullback or possibly a more significant corrective phase in the fourth quarter for the S&P 500, suggesting that this could mark the beginning of a range-bound environment. She pointed to indicators such as the VIX, which has entered a new higher volatility cycle, and mentioned signs of long-term exhaustion indicated by the DeMark indicators, levels not seen collectively since late 2021. While this does not necessarily signal an impending bear market, it does enhance the likelihood of experiencing a choppier trading environment. When asked about the recent performance of banks and cyclical stocks compared to defensive stocks, Stockton acknowledged that while there has been a positive move from the financial sector contributing to the S&P 500’s recent gains, it is too early to conclude that this represents a breakout in relative strength for financials. She indicated that most metrics suggest financials will likely perform in line with broader market trends rather than leading them. Furthermore, she expressed concern that mega-cap sectors are poised to lose their leadership position, which could pose challenges to overall market performance. Regarding small-cap stocks, Stockton noted that while the Russell 2000 index made another attempt at an upside move, closing close to 2,300 with a 1.6% increase, long-term trends still indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500. She pointed out that there has not been a breakout in the Russell 2000, which remains stalled below resistance levels established during summer highs. Consequently, she does not see actionable opportunities in small caps at this time and anticipates neutral trading conditions for this segment. On the topic of bonds, Stockton mentioned that Treasury yields have shown some upside momentum but backed off recently. She sees potential entry points in Treasury bond proxies like TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), suggesting signs of short-term downside exhaustion within a broader long-term uptrend for fixed income. She believes there is an opportunity for investors to enter Treasury bond proxies now, while also expecting yields to stall without significant long-term declines. Her insights highlight her focus on maintaining balance amid prevailing uncertainties in both equity and bond markets.

Strong financials and positive analyst sentiment make it a promising investment option. Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering.

We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.” Overall, GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-10-20T18:53:17+00:00,Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Among the Best US Stocks for Foreign Investors Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-googl-among-best-185317776.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other US stocks.

Despite previous recession predictions, the market has shown resilience and continued to rise, largely due to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. Current market valuations are trading at approximately 22 times earnings during an easing cycle, raising questions about future earnings growth. There seems to be a disconnect between expectations for significant easing and projected strong earnings growth.

Investors are encouraged to remain vigilant and consider the evolving economic landscape as they navigate potential market shifts. Earlier in October, Jason Trennert, Strategas Research Partners chairman and CEO, joined CNBC to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy, highlighting that the bar is high to get bearish now. We covered his opinion in our article about the 8 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Invest In Now in much more detail. Here's an excerpt from that discussion:

On October 16, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to discuss the latest market trends, highlighting that he has never seen investors this afraid of a market that's doing so well. J.J. Kinahan noted that the upcoming weeks would be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and the impending election, alongside uncertainty surrounding the Fed's next moves. He remarked on the market's resilience, highlighting that there have been 46 new highs for the S&P 500 this year, despite a general sentiment of skepticism among investors. He expressed that it is unusual for a market to perform so well while simultaneously being viewed with caution and fear.

Kinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents' experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. He also speculated that part of the reason for the market's strong performance might be attributed to older investors who have been burned in previous downturns and are now waiting for a pullback that has yet to materialize. Kinahan suggested that as these investors gradually capitulate, they may start to invest more actively in the market. Discussing interest rates, Kinahan acknowledged that while the Fed is in a massive easing cycle, there seems to be a disconnect with the bond market recently. He mentioned a study indicating that volatility during election years is not significantly greater than in non-election years. Currently, volatility is relatively low, hovering around a historical average of 20, and only recently rising to this level. He explained that typically, volatility tends to increase after elections, when political changes begin to take effect and policies, are implemented. He anticipated that January would bring more clarity regarding how these changes might impact the markets. Kinahan's insights reflect a complex interplay between investor sentiment, market performance, and external economic factors as they navigate through earnings season and an election year. His perspective underscores a cautious optimism about the market's ability to maintain its upward trajectory despite prevailing uncertainties. To find the best US stocks for foreign investors, we used Insider Monkey's proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite and that analysts were bullish on. We then selected the top 8 stocks with the highest average analysts' upside potential. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their average analysts' upside potential, as of October 16.

2024-10-20T17:59:41+00:00,Alphabet (GOOG): Among the Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-goog-among-most-profitable-175941072.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other profitable stocks.

In an interview with CNBC on October 14, Michael Kantrowitz, Chief Investment Officer at Piper Sandler noted that while the market is expensive, it's not a reason to get bearish and that unless a risk arises, the market will likely stay expensive. Kantrowitz explains that the market's valuation is driven by the pricing out of risks that existed two years ago, such as inflation and higher interest rates. He believes that if these risks were to resurface, it would be a reason to get worried, but currently, that's not the backdrop.

He also notes that investors should focus on stocks with continued earnings momentum, as these names will likely see the best outperformance and can hold their expensive multiples for longer. Kantrowitz is not too concerned about higher bond yields but notes that they can be a problem at some point. He thinks that yields would need to reach 4.25% to show up in the broader market.

Regarding earnings revisions, Kantrowitz believes that revisions coming down have not overdone it and that it's normal to see estimates from the sell-side start out high and then trickle down throughout the year. He expects to see more downward earnings revisions but notes that large-cap stocks have held up far better in terms of earnings, which is why they continue to outperform.

Tom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors discussed the markets and his recent observations. Lee believes that the market's resilience is due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines. He thinks that investors have been under-invested in stocks and that the market is becoming less dependent on macro data.

Lee pointed out that the market has been able to shrug off negative news and that the recent PPI and CPI reports were not enough to knock the market off track. He believes that the Fed will continue to be dovish, especially since inflation is still tracking towards the 2% target. Lee also thinks that the election, which is becoming less of a coin toss, is also contributing to the market's conviction.

Regarding the impact of the election on the market, Lee believes that markets like visibility, but they also need to like what they see on the other side of the election. He thinks that whether Trump or Harris wins, stocks will do well next year, but there will be differences in sector and asset class performance depending on who wins.

While some may be concerned about the market's expensive valuation, others see it as a sign of strength and resilience, with that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. To compile our list of the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 10-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 10-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Our list is sorted in ascending order of the 10-year net income growth rates. Why do we care about what hedge funds do?

2024-10-20T14:45:39+00:00,Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best IoT Stock To Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-googl-best-iot-144539824.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other IoT stocks.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network connecting physical objects to the internet. Industries are embracing IoT technologies for applications like smart manufacturing and supply chain management. Enterprise IoT spending is expected to slow down in the second half of this year due to economic concerns which will affect corporate spending in general.

IoT is a major force behind healthcare's digital transformation, revolutionizing the way medical data is collected, analyzed, and used. This is leading to better patient care, greater operational efficiencies, and innovative treatments.

IoT is also seeing increased adoption in warehouse management. The global IoT warehouse management market is projected to grow from $14.8 billion in 2023 to $57.2 billion by 2033, reflecting a CAGR of 14.5% over the next decade. This growth is driven by the need for better inventory management, increased automation, and improved operational efficiency in logistics and supply chain operations.

2024-10-20T13:00:23+00:00,Is There An Opportunity With Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) 33% Undervaluation?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-alphabet-inc-nasdaq-googl-130023630.html,"
• Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Alphabet fair value estimate is US$242
• The US$201 analyst price target for GOOGL is 17% less than our estimate of fair value

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.

We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.

See our latest analysis for Alphabet

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$932b

We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.0t÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$2.1t The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.0t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$163, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.066. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
• Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.
• Debt is not viewed as a risk.
• Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.
• Annual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.
• Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.
• Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market. Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

2024-10-20T08:45:00+00:00,Tesla Stock vs. Alphabet Stock: Wall Street Says Buy One and Sell the Other,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-vs-alphabet-stock-084500443.html,"Despite soaring interest in artificial intelligence (AI), ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin during the past year. Specifically, Tesla shares fell 9%, and Alphabet shares advanced 18%, while the S&P 500 soared 36%.

Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Tesla to slide lower over the next year, but analysts think Alphabet will produce sizable gains. Here are the specifics from The Wall Street Journal:
• Among the 58 analysts who follow Tesla, the average 12-month price target is $216 per share. That forecast implies 2% downside from its current share price of $221.
• Among the 68 analysts who follow Alphabet, the average 12-month price target is $203 per share. That forecast implies 24% upside from its current share price of $163.

Investors should never rely on price targets, but they are a good place to begin researching a company. Here are the important details on Tesla and Alphabet.

Tesla has stumbled due to macroeconomic challenges. High interest rates have exacerbated inflationary pressure on consumer wallets, suppressing demand for electric cars. Tesla has cut prices several times to boost demand, but its leading market share fell 3.1 percentage points year to date through August, and the price cuts have weighed heavily on its financial results.

Tesla narrowly topped the consensus sales estimate in the second quarter, but its earnings fell short for the fourth consecutive time. Specifically, while revenue increased 2% to $25.5 billion, operating expenses soared 39%, and non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income declined 43% to $0.52 per diluted share. However, there were a few silver linings, including increased production of its 4680 battery cell, something management called a ""major cost reduction milestone.""

Tesla recently hosted a robotaxi event where it unveiled the Cybercab. The self-driving vehicle lacking a steering wheel and pedals will enter production in 2027 and cost less than $30,000. CEO Elon Musk also said Tesla would launch an unsupervised version of its full self-driving (FSD) software in California and Texas next year. But investors are justifiably skeptical, given that the company has overpromised in the past.

Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Tesla's earnings to increase by 12% annually over the next three years. That estimate makes the current valuation of 62 times earnings look very expensive. However, Tesla could beat the consensus forecast if its FSD software can truly function without supervision by 2025. That could boost FSD subscription sales and allow a quick launch of robotaxi services.

Personally, I think eager investors can buy a small position in the stock here, provided they know its long-term performance depends greatly on Tesla's ability to transition toward high-margin artificial intelligence revenue (i.e., FSD software and robotaxi services) and away from capital-intensive automobile manufacturing. Having said that, it may be more prudent to wait for additional details concerning unsupervised FSD and the Cybercab. Alphabet is the global leader in digital advertising, with an estimated market share of 27.4% in 2024, according to eMarketer. That dominance stems from its ability to source data and engage consumers with popular internet platforms like Google Search and YouTube. Alphabet has long used AI to inform its search engine and ad tech software, but it has recently added generative AI capabilities to further improve the user experience. Alphabet also operates the third-largest public cloud in Google Cloud Platform. While its market share trails that of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure by a wide margin, strength in AI infrastructure and large language models helped the company gain a percentage point of market share over the past year. ""Google's Gemini combines a world-class model with enterprise cloud services,"" according to analysts at Forrester Research. Alphabet reported solid financial results in the second quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 14% to $84.7 billion due to strong momentum in the cloud computing unit and more modest growth in the advertising segment. Meanwhile, GAAP net income increased 31% to $1.89 per diluted share due to continued cost control efforts. Beyond advertising and cloud computing, Alphabet also has a long-term opportunity with its autonomous driving subsidiary, Waymo. The company provides more than 100,000 rides weekly across Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. It has partnered with Uber to bring autonomous ride-hailing services to Atlanta and Austin in 2025. Analysts at Bank of America estimate Waymo's revenue could reach $75 million this year, an inconsequential sum compared to Alphabet's total revenue, but the autonomous driving unit should become increasingly significant in the future. The robotaxi market is projected to increase at 67% annually to reach $108 billion by 2031, according to Straits Research. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase by 17% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 23.4 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 1.4, which matches the three-year average. Long-term investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this stock today.

2024-10-20T08:15:00+00:00,2 Stocks That Could Join Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-could-join-nvidia-081500746.html,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to profit off the artificial intelligence (AI) boom over the last two years. Shares of the AI chip leader have surged more than 820% since 2022 and currently have of a market cap of nearly $3.3 trillion -- trailing only Apple's $3.5 trillion.

The following ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are not far behind and could deliver exceptional returns in the next few years to join Nvidia and Apple in the $3 trillion club.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares have delivered life-changing returns to investors over the last few decades and continue to generate market-beating gains. The stock has doubled over the last five years, bringing its total market cap to $2 trillion. Based on the company's opportunities, the shares could climb another 50% in the next few years to reach $3 trillion in total market value.

When you deliver billions of orders each year, every last mile of cost adds up. Amazon was able to reduce the cost to serve retail customers in 2023 for the first time since 2018. It continues to find ways to strip costs out of the retail business. The company's operating profit has doubled over the last year, as it shortens and optimizes delivery routes.

Reducing costs can benefit Amazon more than simply boosting its short-term profitability. It also can allow Amazon to gain market share in online shopping by lowering prices on select goods. Shortening transportation distances also means customers receive their orders faster, and that can lead to more frequent shopping.

Amazon says it has plenty of opportunities to reduce costs by using automation and robotics and continuing to build its same-day delivery network. The company already controlled 37% of the U.S. e-commerce market in 2023 -- 6 times the share of No. 2 Walmart, according to Statista. Amazon's efforts to improve efficiencies and speed up order delivery show a relentless competitor continuing to look for ways to protect and stretch its lead. This is the kind of business you want protecting and growing your savings for retirement.

Analysts expect earnings to reach $7.30 per share by 2026, an increase of 52% over 2024 estimates. Amazon investors can expect the stock to climb along with that increase and reach a $3 trillion market cap within two years.

Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) also doubled in the last five years. The company's market cap is currently hovering around $2 trillion, putting it within striking distance of Nvidia's market value.

While Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud service provider for enterprises, many businesses prefer Google Cloud. Google has been steadily gaining share of the cloud market in recent years. New AI services offered in Google Cloud are fueling its momentum. The company credited strong demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI services for driving recent growth in the cloud. Google Cloud's revenue grew to more than $10 billion in the second quarter, but equally important, the segment's operating profit nearly tripled to surpass $1.1 billion last quarter. This shows Alphabet is earning a high return on investment on AI tools offered to Google Cloud customers like Vertex and the Gemini AI model. It's also impressive that Alphabet can make the necessary investments to drive strong demand for cloud services and AI while producing solid earnings growth. Earnings grew 31% year over year in Q2, and analysts expect Alphabet's earnings to grow 16% over the long term. By 2026, the consensus estimate has Alphabet's earnings reaching $10. If Alphabet earns a market average price-to-earnings ratio of around 27, the shares could be worth $270, implying upside of 62%. It could easily hit a $3 trillion market cap in two years.

2024-10-20T04:55:51+00:00,Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Among the Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-googl-among-most-045551115.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks owned by hedge funds.

Wall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a ‘substantial majority’ of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead.

The broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank’s next meeting in November.

However, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth.

She noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas.

Fundstrat Global Advisors’ co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month:

Earlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to ‘buy the dip’, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value.

Adam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast. With that said, let’s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the world’s leading technology companies by revenue and owns several notable platforms such as Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, YouTube, and more. On August 5, the US Department of Justice ruled against Alphabet in an anti-trust lawsuit regarding search dominance, with the judge declaring that the company stifled competition in the online search market to maintain its monopoly. This could lead to the company paying billions of dollars in hefty fines or legal settlements. Then earlier this month, in another case, a district judge ordered Google to overhaul its mobile app business and open the Play Store to rival firms. These verdicts have hurt Alphabet’s reputation and led to a bearish sentiment in some circles. Financially, the company continues to remain strong. Driven by solid performances from Google Search and Google Cloud, Alphabet reported robust results in Q2 with revenues totaling $84.7 billion, increasing 14% from last year. Net income for the quarter stood at $23.6 billion, which represented an EPS of $1.89, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.85 per share. Google Services revenue was recorded at $73.9 billion, up from $66.2 billion in 2023. The ‘Google Search & Other’ segment revenue totaled $48.5 billion, while YouTube and Google Network earned $8.7 billion and $7.4 billion in revenues during Q2. Strong results during the quarter have helped Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) garner substantial investor optimism. Here is what The London Company Large Cap Strategy stated about Alphabet in its Q2 2024 investor letter: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) – GOOG was a top performer this quarter as it reported strong Search revenue, tighter cost controls, and momentum in Cloud. Both direct and brand Search ads were better than expected and the strength in YouTube monetization continues. Expense controls have translated to 700bps of margin improvement. Management is removing layers to improve efficiency, which should drive margins higher. GOOG also provided details on paths to monetize Al for advertisers. GOOG initiated a dividend during the quarter to return additional cash to shareholders. It has a solid balance sheet, a significant market share, and generates strong returns. According to the Insider Monkey database for Q2 2024, Alphabet is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now, with 216 funds having a stake in the company. Wall Street analysts are also bullish on the stock, with consensus among them on Alphabet’s Buy rating. They also anticipate an upside potential of 20% in the company’s share price. Overall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

2024-10-20T00:00:00+00:00,Is Alphabet Stock a Buy Now?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/20/is-alphabet-stock-a-buy-now/,"Investors will find no shortage of reasons to appreciate this business.

Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%) shares have produced a monster 6,510% return since their initial public offering in 2004. That gain certainly made early investors rich. But shares are taking a breather, as they're down about 13% from their peak from July this year.

If you're considering buying this top technology stock, which is worth more than $2 trillion at the time of this writing, continue reading to understand why that's a very smart decision for your portfolio.

I think the mark of a truly outstanding company is the presence of an economic moat. In other words, does the business in question possess durable competitive advantages that allow it to succeed financially for an extended period of time? Alphabet certainly fits the bill here. In fact, there are likely multiple competitive strengths at play.

For starters, Alphabet benefits from network effects. Its Google Search engine becomes more valuable to all stakeholders, including internet users, website publishers, and advertisers, the larger it gets. And YouTube, the leading streaming service, becomes better as the content offerings and viewership grows.

With 15 products and services that are each used by half a billion people or more, Alphabet is able to collect more data than nearly all businesses on Earth. In the internet age, this is an advantage. Alphabet can use this valuable info to glean insights that can inform corporate strategy and product development efforts.

In the past five years, Alphabet's return on invested capital (ROIC) has averaged 23.8%. This means that for every $100 reinvested into the business, the company is able to earn about $24 in profit. The fact that Alphabet's ROIC is more than double that of the average for the S&P 500 clearly demonstrates just how wonderful this business really is. Companies that don't possess economic moats typically have consistently low ROIC metrics.

The market is full of growing and unprofitable businesses that aren't in the best financial shape. Investors who prioritize growth above all else might gravitate to these types of companies. But this adds risk to the equation. These unproven business models rely on favorable macroeconomic conditions in order to keep running.

Alphabet doesn't fall into this category. This company has been raking in profits for a very long time. For every $100 in revenue generated in Q2 (ended June 30), operating income was a stellar $32. Even during the digital ad market's weak period in 2022, Alphabet was still able to report an operating margin of 26%. The business has reached tremendous scale that allows it to leverage its expenses to the benefit of shareholders.

Alphabet produced $102 billion in operating cash flow last year. Management uses capital that's left after reinvesting into the business to fund ongoing share repurchases, as well as to help pay for the newly announced dividend. Risk is also drastically reduced because the company is sitting on a fortress balance sheet that has a current net cash position of $87 billion. This gives Alphabet the resources to invest in new areas, like artificial intelligence.

Alphabet has historically been a winning stock. And today, the company's market cap is north of $2 trillion. However, this doesn't mean that you're too late to the party. Even some of the most closely watched businesses are still worthy investment candidates.

As of this writing, Alphabet shares trade for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.8. This makes it the cheapest option among the popular ""Magnificent Seven"" grouping. Regulatory uncertainty might be the key factor weighing on the stock right now. But that doesn't take away from the fact that this is one of the highest-quality businesses out there. It deserves a spot in your portfolio.",GOOGL,yes,eod,779
2024-10-20T00:00:00+00:00,"If You Bought 1 Share of Alphabet Stock at Its IPO, Here's How Many Shares You Would Own Now",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/20/if-you-bought-1-share-of-alphabet-stock-at-its-ipo/,"Sometimes, even stocks that begin as large caps can drive massive returns.

This year marks 20 years since Alphabet (GOOGL 1.57%) (GOOG 1.50%), known then as Google, Inc., launched its IPO. The company faced significant regulatory scrutiny at that time, and a desire to launch its IPO at a higher price gave way to pressure, pushing the IPO price down to a split-adjusted $2.13 per share.

Despite such challenges, the company evolved into a digital advertising juggernaut, and the profits generated from that business led to Alphabet acquiring numerous other companies. With that expansion, even an investor with one pre-split share earned massive gains over the last 20 years.

Investors who bought one share in 2004 would now hold 40 shares -- 20 shares with voting power under the ""GOOGL"" symbol and 20 that do not have voting rights and trade under the ""GOOG"" symbol.

This is because the company initiated an unusual 2-for-1 stock split in 2014 when it created a third class of non-voting shares (only insiders own the second class of shares, known as ""B"" shares). Also, each class of Alphabet stock split 20-for-1 in 2022, leading to the current weighting of shares.

Consequently, this holding in Alphabet would have yielded a total return of just under $6,700 today, including the dividend that began in the second quarter of 2024.

Admittedly, that gain might disappoint compared to the lifetime gains of Amazon, whose one share at the 1997 IPO is now worth about $34,000.

However, Amazon's market cap was only about $450 million at the time, meaning it had already doubled approximately six times when it reached Alphabet's IPO market cap of about $27 billion.

This distinction is important since, today, companies tend to launch IPOs when they have already reached large-cap status. Nonetheless, the Alphabet example shows that it is not too late to earn considerable gains from such a market cap. If one can apply these lessons to a future tech industry leader, massive returns are still possible.",GOOGL,yes,eod,439

As a result, Google might not have to open up its Play Store for years, if at all, while it appears the jury verdict in the Epic legal battle, The Verge’s Wes Davis and Sean Hollister report. The one exception to the stay, however, is that starting November 1, 2024 and continuing until November 1, 2027, Google is prohibited from making deals with carriers or device makers that block preinstallation of competing app stores in exchange for money, revenue share, or perks, the authors note. Investors in Epic include Tencent (TCEHY), KKR (KKR), Disney (DIS), and Sony (SONY).

2024-10-19T18:11:20+00:00,Analysts Say Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) Among Top Beneficiaries of AI Data Center Spend,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-181120716.html,"We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. Since Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Wall Street continues to gain momentum amid the latest earnings season and analysts are wondering whether we are still up for soft landing. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said:

“I think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.”

The analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however.

“My probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it’s not dominant. Why isn’t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan—at the end of July, the Fed didn’t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it’s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.”

For this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Citi Research predicts that capital expenditures for data centers among the leading four cloud companies will surge by 40% year over year, offering a boost to data center interconnect (DCI) providers. The major players in this segment include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Citi anticipates that these firms will ramp up their data center investments by 40% to 50% in 2025.

Citi analysts, led by Atif Malik, noted in an investor report that “we estimate that the AI networking opportunity is expanding beyond the server connection within a data center to AI platforms connecting multiple data centers through DCI.” Citi named Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) as one of the beneficiaries of this spending. Malik emphasized the challenges of containing AI model clusters within a single data center as their size approaches 300,000 GPUs by 2025, stating that “containing models in one data center unit will not be sustainable in the long term amid constraints related to power, regulations, among others.” Consequently, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting and planning to expand the use of a multi-data center training approach. Citi highlighted that Google has utilized this multi-data center strategy for training its Gemini 1 Ultra, and that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic are also embracing this model. As a result of increased DCI spending, Citi projects that Arista’s revenue could grow by up to 25% year over year in 2025, primarily driven by Ethernet switching in AI networks. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) earlier this year announced a major restructuring plan that includes a 7% reduction in workforce and an estimated $1 billion in pre-tax cost savings. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)’s legacy hardware businesses have been stagnating, with average revenue growth lingering at just 1.6%. Job cuts and cost savings will allow Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) to allocate capital to high-growth areas like AI and Cloud networking. The expected cost savings, which will cut about 2.4% of total operating expenses, could boost Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) operating margins by more than 220 basis points in FY25. Although the company is ramping up its AI efforts, it only expects AI to bring in around $1 billion in revenue next year, less than 2% of the total. So, while AI isn’t likely to be a game-changer for Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) just yet, the focus on growth markets might accelerate overall revenue in the future. Parnassus Value Equity Fund stated the following regarding Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “During the second quarter, the Fund’s overweight position in the Information Technology sector decreased slightly as we sold our position in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and used most of the proceeds to buy Broadcom, a leading semiconductor company and provider of custom silicon products. Both stocks provide similar exposure to networking technology, but we believe Broadcom offers more upside from AI infrastructure spend and defensiveness due to its software assets.” Overall, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CSCO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

2024-10-19T13:15:12+00:00,"Nvidia to win the race to $4 trillion market cap, experts say",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-win-the-race-to-4-trillion-market-cap-experts-say-131512935.html,"That was the mindset around chip stocks last week as investors scooped up beaten-down shares, sending Nvidia (NVDA) to a record high. A strong outlook for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was enough to revive Wall Street’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence as growing confidence in the AI boom overshadowed chip supplier ASML’s sluggish forecast and reports of export caps of advanced AI chips to some Middle Eastern countries.

Nvidia closed the week above $138 per share, bringing its market value to $3.39 trillion. The stock was trading a touch higher, up 0.2%, in Monday's premarket trading.

It’s now the world's second-largest company behind Apple (AAPL). But that might not be for long. Experts I spoke with this past week say there’s growing confidence the chip giant will be the first Big Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation.

“There's no question about it,” Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts (video above). “The demand for GPU chips is strong, and you're seeing early adopters starting to get some ROI.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang fueled the stock’s rally earlier this month after describing demand for the new Blackwell chips as “insane.”

Even amid the stock’s dramatic outperformance, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Tony Wang told me investors still “continuously underestimate” Nvidia’s growth potential. He sees “exceptional” demand for AI making it “definitely possible” that the chip giant crosses that $4 trillion threshold first.

In the coming weeks, earnings from fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" companies will give investors better insight into Nvidia’s market dominance. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), which account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue, have all pledged to continue investing in AI.

Last quarter, spending by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft totaled more than $40 billion, while Amazon said spending in the second half of the year will likely surpass the $30 billion spent during the first half.

BofA analyst Vivek Arya, who views Nvidia as a “generational opportunity,” cites capital expenditure commentary from top hyperscalers among the reasons that he sees Nvidia ""strengthening its position.""

Arya lifted his price target on the chipmaker to $190 last week, implying a rally of nearly 40% from Friday’s closing price.

Arya and his team also cited Taiwan Semiconductor’s robust demand outlook as a positive. TSMC — a top supplier for Nvidia and other giants, including Apple — triggered a sector-wide rally after posting a more than 50% jump in net income for the third quarter and forecasting full-year revenue growth of nearly 30%.

Safe to say, Big Tech's third quarter numbers will be a crucial test for Nvidia and key to the stock's momentum in the short term. Any disappointment in AI spending plans could lead to volatility for Nvidia and the broader chips market. But if that happens, the sell-off may not last long. Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles recently told me on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast he remains bullish on Nvidia’s long-term prospects. “You've got several more years of AI investment before you hit saturation or a more maturing AI landscape,” Niles said. “You'll see Nvidia's revenues double over the next several years, and I think you'll see the stock double over the next several years.” Nvidia shares have rallied 21% so far this month, bringing its gains to 179% year to date.

US District Judge James Donato on Friday granted the delay, but only until there is a ruling by the federal appeals court in San Francisco on Google’s separate request to put his Oct. 7 order on hold. Donato mandated the changes after a trial of antitrust claims by Epic Games Inc. A jury found Google abused its power in the Android app market.

“We’re pleased with the district court’s decision to temporarily pause the implementation of dangerous remedies demanded by Epic, as the court of appeal considers our request to further pause the remedies while we appeal,” a Google spokesperson said.

While granting a short-term delay, Donato denied Google’s request for a long-term stay on his order because he said the company failed to show it was “warranted, especially with respect to likelihood of success on the merits and the public interest.”

Epic Games, in a statement, said Donato’s temporary stay was just a “procedural step” that gives the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals time to rule. “Today the Court made it clear that Google’s appeal is meritless and rejected their request to delay opening up Android devices to competition while the appeal is ongoing,” the gamemaker said.

Donato’s order required Google Play to allow developers to set up app marketplaces and offer consumers billing options other than its own payment system. He set a Nov. 1 deadline to complete the changes — sooner than Google had said was possible.

On Oct. 11, Google sought a stay on Donato’s remedies. The one recommendation it didn’t object to was for the company to stop using payments, revenue sharing or access to its services to secure prominent placement for Google Play on mobile devices.

The Google Play business generated $14.66 billion in sales in 2020. Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Mandeep Singh has estimated that in a worst-case scenario, Google Play could face a $1.15 billion drag on Alphabet’s gross profit.

Having supervised important products like Search, Ads, Assistant, Geo, Commerce, and Payments, Raghavan will move into his new position after over 12 years with the companyfirm.

CEO Sundar Pichai, in a blog post on Thursday, revealed the leadership transition, saying Raghavan will be working closely with him in this new position. Long-time Google employee Nick Fox, a Raghavan's leadership team member, will take up Raghavan's old duties directing Google's Knowledge and Information teams. These include items in Search, Ads, Geo, and Commerce domains.

Before joining Google, Raghavan managed the design of ad markets and search and ad ranking at Yahoo! Labs.

For Google, this change in leadership is crucial as the business is under more and more examination in the U.S. and the European Union. Antitrust actions in many countries claim that Google's operational independence and business strategy are seriously challenged by unfair activities in which it participates in web search and online advertising marketplaces.

2024-10-18T19:20:35+00:00,Judge delays order in antitrust case requiring Google to open up its app store,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/judge-delays-order-antitrust-case-192035065.html,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge on Friday delayed an order requiring Google to open up its Android app store to more competition until an appeals court decides whether to block the shake-up because of legal questions surrounding a jury's verdict that branded Google as an illegal monopolist.

The delay granted during a court hearing in San Francisco comes less than two weeks after U.S. District Judge James Donato issued a decision that would have forced Google to make sweeping changes to its Play Store for Android smartphones starting Nov. 1.

The mandated changes included a provision that would have required Google to make its library of more than 2 million Android apps available to any rivals that wanted access to the inventory and also distribute the alternative options in its own Play Store.

Google requested Donato's order be stayed until the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals could examine the handling of a monthlong trial that led to the December 2023 verdict, which framed the Play Store as an illegal monopoly that stifles innovation and drives up consumer prices.

In Friday's hearing, Donato scoffed at the notion that Google could succeed in overturning the trial verdict. “The verdict in this case was amply supported by a mountain of evidence about Google’s anti-competitive conduct,” the judge said.

But he decided the Ninth Circuit should be given a chance to consider a postponement until a panel of judges can decide can consider Google's appeal of the 2023 trial focused on antitrust claims lodged by video game maker Epic Games.

Donato said he wouldn't be surprised if the Ninth Circuit imposes an even longer delay on his ruling, “but that is for someone else to decide.”

In a statement, Google said it was pleased Donato hit the pause button while it tries to extend the delay even further.

“These remedies threaten Google Play’s ability to provide a safe and secure experience and we look forward to continuing to make our case to protect 100 million U.S. Android users, over 500,000 U.S. developers and thousands of partners who have benefited from our platforms,” Google said.

Epic pointed to Donato's critical comments about the merits of Google's appeal in a statement that described the stay as a “procedural step.”

It's unclear how long the Ninth Circuit will take to decide on Google's request for a permanent stay of Donato's ruling while its appeals unfolds — a process that could take more than a year.

In 2021, the Ninth Circuit delayed a provision of another federal judge's order mandating that Apple allow links to alternative payment systems with apps made for the iPhone as part of another antitrust case brought by Epic.

Although Apple avoided being labeled an illegal monopolist in a trial involving the iPhone app store, it unsuccessfully fought the provision requiring the company to allow alternative payment links within apps. But delaying that requirement preserved Apple's exclusive control of a payment system that has generated commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on some e-commerce occurring within apps. Apple exhausted its avenue of appeals in the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year. Google also pockets billions of dollars annually from a similar commission system within its Play Store for Android phones — a setup that is allowed to continue as long as Google can prevent Donato's ruling from taking effect. In its arguments for delaying Donato's order, Google said it wasn't being given enough time to make the drastic changes it framed as “a Herculean task creating an unacceptable risk of safety and security failures within the Android ecosystem.” In its Friday statement, Epic blasted Google's tactics as “fearmongering.” Google also argued the shake-up would saddle it with unreasonable costs, a contention Donato also brushed aside during Friday's hearing. “I don’t want to be glib about it, but the expense that Google might incur appears to be a drop in the bucket compared to the profits it reaps annually from the Play Store,"" Donato said.",GOOGL,yes,eod,789
2024-10-18T18:58:14+00:00,Google granted request to pause order on Play store overhaul,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-judge-grants-google-request-185814084.html,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in California has granted Google's request to temporarily pause his order directing the Alphabet unit to overhaul its Android app store Play by Nov. 1 to give consumers more choice over how they download software.

San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge James Donato made the decision on Friday as part of an antitrust lawsuit against Google by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games. Google argued that Donato's Oct. 7 injunction would harm the company and introduce ""serious safety, security and privacy risks into the Android ecosystem.""

Donato delayed the injunction to allow the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to consider Google's separate request to pause the judge's order.

Donato denied Google's separate request to pause the order for the duration of its broader appeal in the case.

""We're pleased with the District Court's decision to temporarily pause the implementation of dangerous remedies demanded by Epic, as the Court of Appeal considers our request to further pause the remedies while we appeal,"" Google said in a statement.

Epic in a statement called Donato's ruling a procedural step, and said the court ""made it clear that Google's appeal is meritless and rejected their request to delay opening up Android devices to competition while the appeal is ongoing.""

Epic accused Google of using ""fearmongering and unsubstantiated security threats to protect their control over Android devices and continue extracting exorbitant fees.""

In the Epic Games lawsuit, a jury last year found that Google illegally monopolized how consumers download apps on Android devices and how they pay for in-app transactions. The judge, in his order, embraced many of the steps recommended by Epic in light of the jury's decision.

The order required Google to allow users to download competing third-party Android app platforms or stores in Play and to allow the use of competing in-app payment methods. It also barred Google from making payments to device makers to preinstall its app store and from sharing revenue generated from the Play store with other app distributors.

Google has already appealed the jury's antitrust findings to the 9th Circuit.

Google has not presented its antitrust arguments to the appeals court. It previously has said that it cannot be considered a monopolist because Play and Apple's App Store are direct competitors, and that Donato's injunction would unlawfully force Google to do business with rivals.",GOOGL,yes,eod,472
2024-10-18T18:36:13+00:00,"One of the largest solar projects in the US opens in Texas, backed by Google",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-largest-solar-projects-us-183613441.html,"One of the largest solar projects in the U.S. opened in Texas on Friday, backed by what Google said is the largest solar electricity purchase it has ever made.

Google executive Ben Sloss said at the ribbon cutting, about two hours south of Dallas, that the corporation has a responsibility to bring renewable, carbon-free electricity online at the same time it opens operations that will use that power. Google expects to spend $16 billion through 2040 globally to purchase clean energy, he said.

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who attended, said the solar project is a posterchild for the administration's efforts to incentivize manufacturers and developers to locate energy projects in the U.S.

“Sometimes when you are in the middle of history, it’s hard to tell, because you are in the middle of it,” she said. “But I'm telling you right now that we are in the middle of history being made.”

SB Energy built three solar farms side by side, the “Orion Solar Belt,"" in Buckholts, Texas. Combined, they will be able to provide 875 megawatts of clean energy. That is nearly the size of a typical nuclear facility. In total, Google has contracted with clean energy developers to bring more than 2,800 megawatts of new wind and solar projects to the state, which it says exceeds the amount of power required for its operations there.

Google, Amazon and Microsoft have all recently announced investments in nuclear energy to power data centers, too, as the tech giants seek new sources of carbon-free electricity to meet surging demand from data centers and artificial intelligence. Google has a commitment to get all of its electricity without contributing to climate change, regardless of time of day or whether the sun is up, but neither it nor other large companies are meeting those commitments with the rise of artificial intelligence.

The International Energy Agency forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026, more than doubling from 2022. Estimates suggest one terawatt-hour can power 70,000 homes for a year.

The demand for power is also growing globally as buildings and vehicles electrify. People used more electricity than ever last year, placing strain on electric grids around the world.

In August, Google said it planned to invest more than $1 billion in Texas this year to support its cloud and data center infrastructure.

Google will use about 85% of the project’s solar power for data centers in Ellis County and for cloud computing in the Dallas region. In Ellis County, Google operates a data center campus in Midlothian and is building out a new campus in Red Oak. The rest of the solar power will go to the state’s electrical grid. Thousands of sheep graze in the area, maintaining the vegetation around the solar arrays.

“This project was a spreadsheet and a set of emails that I had been exchanging and a bunch of approvals and so on. And then you come over the rise over there and you see it laid out in front of you and it kind of takes your breath away, right? Because there’s this enormous field of solar arrays,” Sloss said during the ceremony. “And we actually collectively have done this. That is amazing.” SB Energy said most of the solar farm components are made in the United States, and that's only possible because the climate law formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act spurred clean energy manufacturing. The company expects the projects to be the first to qualify for an extra tax credit the law affords for using domestic content.

2024-10-18T16:51:50+00:00,Exclusive: Waymo engineering exec discusses self-driving AI models that will power the cars into new cities,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-waymo-engineering-exec-discusses-165150697.html,"When I posted on Instagram in May about my first ride in a self-driving, AI-powered Waymo car in San Francisco—a video of an empty driver’s seat with the steering wheel making a smooth left turn on a busy street—the responses ranged from “Yikes” and “That is CRAZY” to “No no no.”

I'll admit, I was a bit freaked out myself as the Waymo, a standout, white, all-electric Jaguar, outfitted with rotating sensors on the roof, ferried me up and down one of San Francisco’s steepest streets. But I was pleasantly surprised (and relieved) to watch the autonomous driver pause fully yet gently at each and every stop sign along the route. The Waymo was a defensive driver, but not too slow; it steered carefully, but ventured into traffic with conviction. I finally exhaled and relaxed.

Waymo's polite chauffeur seems almost like magic. The ride left me wondering: How exactly did my Waymo manage to do this without crashing? Recently, Waymo gave me a chance to find out as it prepares to expand to Atlanta and Austin, adding to its fleets in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Phoenix.

Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet that began as the Google Self-Driving Project in 2009, only started offering rides to the public without human safety drivers within the past few years. In August it announced that it's serving over 100,000 paid rides per week in the handful of U.S. cities it operates in. But as Waymo expands to new cities, it needs to convince tens of thousands of new riders to get over the unsettling feeling of riding in a driverless taxi.

While Waymo has been somewhat circumspect about exactly how its AI-powered self-driving tech works in the past, the company now believes that offering a closer look under the proverbial hood is important for autonomous cars to gain wider acceptance. Srikanth Thirumalai, Waymo’s head of engineering for onboard technology, told Fortune that prioritizing safety in its messaging—rather than focusing on AI—has been crucial for building trust with potential riders. (Naturally, all self-driving vehicle companies must also navigate regulatory scrutiny.)

“We don’t want to take the focus off of what we're actually trying to do here,” Thirumalai told Fortune in his first interview since joining Waymo a year ago after 18 years at Amazon. “We have to lead with ‘hey, we are developing this technology responsibly.'""

But helping more people understand how its AI-powered system works, he explained, is the next stage in the company's 15-year effort to build “the world’s most trusted driver.""

""Sharing more information about our tech and its safety is essential for building trust with riders and communities in which we operate,"" he said.

(Photo by Jason Henry / AFP) (Photo by JASON HENRY/AFP via Getty Images) Beyond the hype of Generative AI While Waymo has pulled ahead of the self-driving competition for the time being, autonomous cars are still very much a work-in-progress. Rivals from GM, Amazon, and Tesla to software developers like Wayve, are pouring billions of dollars into developing their own systems. And regulators are keeping a close eye on the robo-cars currently roaming the roads in designated areas. In February GM's Cruise had its permit yanked by the California DMV last year after an accident in which one of its San Francisco robotaxis struck a pedestrian who had been thrown into its path by another car, dragging the injured woman for 20 feet. The company grounded its fleet across the U.S., and has only recently began testing again in some cities with safety drivers behind the wheel. Waymo has so far avoided serious incidents, but it has made its share of headlines: In May, an unoccupied Waymo taxi hit a telephone pole in Phoenix, Arizona, leading Waymo to issue a voluntary recall and update the software of its entire fleet of 672 autonomous vehicles. In August, there were reports of Waymos honking at each other in a San Francisco parking lot, disturbing neighbors (Waymo said it was an ""unintended consequence"" of a safety feature meant to avoid low-speed collisions when a car is backing up.) And last week, a Waymo came to a halt next to a San Francisco bus right outside of a Y Combinator event, and a video went viral of several tech CEOs attempting to move it (A Waymo representative said that “the bus’s rear door made contact with the side of our vehicle and was unable to close. We dispatched our roadside assistance team to retrieve the vehicle, and before they arrived, bystanders rocked our vehicle free of the door, so the bus could proceed.”) Thirumalai, who focused on AI-powered search and shopping at Amazon before joining Waymo, emphasized his excitement about the challenge of working to power products that function safely and reliably in real-world situations. In fact, it is one of the reasons he joined Waymo. At the same time, he added, it is a humbling way to get beyond the current hype around generative AI. Self-driving cars, he explained, present an extreme “long-tail” learning problem–where events that are rare and unexpected are also, collectively, numerous and a top priority to address. These vehicles require AI that “generalizes really well,” he added, so it can handle both relatively common and predictable situations, like stopping at a red light or yielding to pedestrians, but also surprising or unusual scenarios such as a person in a wheelchair crossing the road at night, or a tree toppling down into the road, or even a herd of circus animals escaped from the back of truck (OK, I made that last one up, but that's the point — the AI needs to be ready for anything). Waymo's dual AI models — on-board and in the cloud To tackle both predictable and “long-tail” driving situations, Waymo’s current technology stack in its cars — as well as a next-generation version still being tested and not yet available to riders — begins with dozens of on-board sensors that allow the car to visualize its environment and provide comprehensive data to help its AI system make real-time decisions. These sensors include radar, high-definition and other video cameras, and external audio receivers, as well as roof-mounted LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors that generate real-time, 360-degree, 3D views and provide depth perception. The array of sensors give the Waymo Driver system overlapping fields of view so that it can simultaneously observe objects, obstacles, or terrain features up to 300 meters away, from different perspectives (the next generation system will have a range of 500 meters on a clear day, Waymo says). The sensors gather data from various scenarios, collected during every trip a Waymo takes. The company also uses synthetic data to train Waymo with simulations of a broader diversity of situations—such as weather conditions—than it might encounter on the roads of Phoenix or San Francisco. SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: The backseat passenger screen is viewed in a Waymo autonomous self-driving Jaguar taxi on March 14, 2024 in Santa Monica, California. Beginning today, Waymo One is offering robotaxi services in a 63-square mile area of greater Los Angeles including Santa Monica, Venice and downtown with over 50,000 people on the wait list. Waymo is owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent company. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Waymo has developed a large-scale AI model called the Waymo Foundation Model that supports the vehicle's ability to perceive its surroundings, predicts the behavior of others on the road, simulates scenarios and makes driving decisions. This massive model functions similarly to large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which are trained on vast datasets to learn patterns and make predictions. Just as companies like OpenAI and Google have built newer multimodal models to combine different types of data (such as text as well as images, audio or video), Waymo’s AI integrates sensor data from multiple sources to understand its environment. The Waymo Foundation Model is a single, massive-sized model, but when a rider gets into a Waymo, the car works off a smaller, onboard model that is ""distilled"" from the much larger one — because it needs to be compact enough in order to run on the car's power. The big model is used as a ""Teacher"" model to impart its knowledge and power to smaller ‘Student’ models — a process widely used in the field of generative AI. The small models are optimized for speed and efficiency and run in real time on each vehicle—while still retaining the critical decision-making abilities needed to drive the car. As a result, perception and behavior tasks, including perceiving objects, predicting the actions of other road users and planning the car's next steps, happen on-board the car in real time. The much larger model can also simulate realistic driving environments to test and validate its decisions virtually before deploying to the Waymo vehicles. The on-board model also means that Waymos are not reliant on a constant wireless internet connection to operate — if the connection temporarily drops, the Waymo doesn't freeze in its tracks. Ultimately, Thirumalai explained, Waymo’s AI system is able to choose the trajectory it believes is the best given the situation. (Waymo would not share specific specs about the models, such as the number of parameters or other details, citing confidentiality.) ""I've seen the future and would be stupid not to be a part of it"" Waymo’s AI system is not the only approach companies are using to tackle self-driving. For example, Wayve, a UK-based startup backed by Microsoft and Meta’s chief scientist Yann LeCun, does not use LiDAR (though it uses high-definition cameras), instead relying on the kinds of cameras and ultrasound sensors that already come as standard in many vehicles, and is heavily-focused on developing a single generative AI “world model"" that interprets visual data and makes driving decisions as one integrated system. Tesla’s autopilot system, which is not yet capable of unsupervised self driving, eschews Lidar and relies on sensors and a suite of eight cameras that provide a 360-degree view around the vehicle. As the automaker pushes towards unsupervised self driving, it has begun testing a new AI system based on neural networks. Wayve, however, does not have hundreds of self-driving robotaxis on the road, like Waymo does – instead, it is developing its software products to deploy in vehicles built by major automotive manufacturers. And Tesla's robotaxi reportedly won't be on the road for at least another couple of years. Waymo's approach, on the other hand, “works backwards from the problem we're trying to solve, which is, how do you actually get these cars in the real world?” SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 01: Waymo cars drive down a street on March 01, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car division, announced that it has laid off over 135 employees in a second round of layoffs this year. Waymo has cut 8 percent of its workforce this year. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) For Thirumalai, the opportunity to help Waymo use AI to reach its safety goals was too good to pass up. ""I was happy at Amazon and wasn't really looking for a change,"" he said. ""Waymo came along and I was just floored by the team, their mission, what they've accomplished so far—it was clear to me that with this tailwind of AI, they were really going to to grow and be a huge force of change for the world."" While I may have had anxious moments going up that steep San Francisco street, Thirumalai had no such concerns. His own first-ever Waymo ride, taken during his interview with Dmitri Dolgov, Waymo’s co-CEO, “blew my mind,"" he said. The Waymo, he said, navigated morning traffic downtown San Francisco and made it up Telegraph Hill all the way to Coit Tower overlooking the city and the bay. To be clear, there is no army of human wizards behind the Waymo curtain helping the car go: ""That would be extremely difficult for us to scale, with the millions, millions of miles we drive every, every month,"" he said, though he emphasized human remote operators are available to step in if a Waymo car gets stuck and needs additional context. As Thirumalai's Waymo safely navigated narrow streets and anticipated pedestrians and even dealt with double-parked cars, he realized he was experiencing a very special ride. ""I’m like, these people have got us to a point where this is driving just as well, if not better, than a human–and they’re doing all this just as AI is taking off,” he said. When Thirumalai returned from his Waymo ride, he told his wife about his experience. ""I said, my God, I’ve seen the future,"" he recalled. ""And I would be stupid not to be a part of it.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",GOOGL,yes,eod,2747

The survey, representing over $1.2 billion in app install spending, reportedly suggests that major players like APP, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are expected to gain market share in 2025, while Unity (U) may lose ground.

In their note, Jefferies analysts said the initial outlook for 2025 app install spending indicates a significant acceleration to 6.7% growth.

While the survey forecasts a modest 2.7% growth for 2024, 2025 is projected to benefit from increased spending on new game launches and successful existing titles.

""We see this initial view into 2025 as optimistic for the ad networks,"" stated Jefferies. The analysts also highlighted that ad spending is expected to grow by 3.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Moreover, Jefferies reported that APP was the largest share gainer in 2024 and is anticipated to continue this momentum into 2025.

""APP's user quality and ability to scale spend"" were underscored as key advantages.

The analysts pointed out that the rising cost per install (CPI) on platforms like YouTube and Meta, particularly due to holiday and political spending, could lead to a shift in shares toward mobile-game-specific networks.

Despite pressures on effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPMs), Jefferies forecasts that the overall mobile game ad revenue will experience growth in 2025.

""Our survey suggests that APP should be able to sustain 20-30% Software Platform revenue growth for at least the next two years,"" the note added.

With this outlook, Jefferies sees a potential bull case price target of $246 for APP, driven by incremental ad budgets from e-commerce.

The disappointment also left the Street questioning the shares’ premium valuation.

The so-called robotaxi is a dazzling promise that has been crucial to keeping Tesla’s stock at lofty heights. It’s also a key part of Elon Musk’s vision for the artificial-intelligence driven future of his company. But with numerous questions remaining about technical details of the vehicles and when they will be available, the shares — trading at 75 times forward earnings — are looking expensive to some.

“This is still a carrot on a string,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “How many new investors will be willing to buy this expensive stock when the core auto business is slow and the company did not show how it will bring the rapid growth in the future?”

Tesla investors have a lot riding on the success of autonomous vehicles. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that Tesla’s core electric-vehicle business is likely worth less than $200 billion, suggesting its market capitalization reflects a value of about $600 billion for other endeavors, such as the robotaxi and the Optimus humanoid robot.

The shares were down 7.5% since the splashy October 10 event through Thursday’s close, but that’s barely dented the premium. The stock was trading nearly unchanged at 10:00 a.m. in New York on Friday. Tesla is by far the most expensive stock in the Magnificent 7, and dwarfs the mid-single-digit multiples of traditional carmakers like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. It’s also much pricier than the Nasdaq 100’s multiple of 26 times forward earnings.

“What worries me the most about Tesla’s valuation is how do you grow into a 75-times price-to-earnings multiple,” said Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “The only way you can is if you have a world-changing technology, which they once did, but the current valuation requires a similarly major leap forward.”

Last week’s glitzy event failed to inspire confidence that such a major leap is coming anytime soon. In the meantime, slowing demand for electric vehicles around the world and rising competition are hitting its sales and profits.

“Tesla’s robotaxi event was long on vision, and short on immediate deliverables or incremental revenue drivers,” Bernstein’s Sacconaghi wrote in a note. The company showed prototypes of a two-door sedan called the Cybercab, a concept van and an updated version of Optimus, but lacked key details that investors had wanted to see. Those included how Tesla will move from selling advanced driver-assistance features to fully autonomous vehicles, its path to regulatory approval, and evidence that it is comfortably ahead of rivals like Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo. There were other kinks, too. The robotaxi will “probably” go into production only in 2026. Bloomberg reported earlier this week humans remotely controlled some capabilities of the robots at the event. And on Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it will assess whether Tesla’s partial-automation system marketed as Full Self-Driving is defective. Sacconaghi noted that Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors when it comes to self-driving technology, and expressed concern that even if it becomes the first to achieve full self-driving, rivals will likely follow soon. “We do not believe the event provided sufficient detail to assuage our concerns, and believe the same is likely true for many investors,” he wrote. To be sure, there are some that are still willing to give Tesla the benefit of the doubt. “First and foremost, Tesla is a Musk company,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research. “As long as Musk is alive and generating ideas and having success in other businesses, people will say if this guy can have a rocket return to a pinpoint, of course he can solve self-driving.” Still, after a 70% rally ahead of the robotaxi event, things are looking challenging for Tesla shares. The next catalyst to watch is third-quarter results, due next week, when analysts expect the company to report a 10% decline in profits from year-ago levels. “In the near-term, what would worry us will be any substantial weakness in car sales, which is still the bread and butter for Tesla,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. Nvidia Corp. shares are roaring back after the chipmaker’s chief executive officer Jensen Huang successfully calmed investor concerns about product delays and its long-term growth prospects.

2024-10-18T13:52:07+00:00,Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) A Good Stock to Buy Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-googl-good-stock-135207821.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 8 Good Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other good stocks to buy right now.

Stocks to Perform Well in 2025

On October 14, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the latest market trends and share his expectations.

In a previous interview, Lee hinted that a period of market volatility is expected, as 2024 heads for a soft landing. However, in this interview, Lee revealed that he had underestimated the market and that it had been extremely resilient and confident, contrary to what he believed earlier. He adds that this indicates the decreasing importance of macroeconomic data to investors.

Lee also adds that for the past two years, investors have been expecting a recession and have held back. Henceforth, with all this cash on the sidelines, investors have been more than willing to invest. October so far has been a great month for the market, despite CPI data being higher than expectations.

Lee emphasizes the need for the Fed to be more supportive as concerns over the job market rise and the upcoming election draws closer. He suggests that despite the election results he expects stocks to perform well in 2025.

The Fed Should Go Slower, Strategist Says

The market rose to an all-time intraday earlier today and the Fed governor stressed the need for caution amid decreasing interest rates. On October 15, Warren Pies, from 3Fourteen, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss his market thesis for the rest of the year.

Pies suggests that rates are the biggest risk to the market at the moment, especially if drastic measures are introduced. He further adds that if the Fed decides to bring the rate down to 3% immediately, the long-term market outlook could be extremely volatile.

He explained that the concern is more about the rate of change and not the absolute level the Fed is trying to achieve. Pies adds that the market still has a lot of room to run before another drastic cut is implemented. He emphasized that the Fed must operate at a pace the market can digest. He also suggested that the market has started to reaccelerate, hinting that a soft landing is more likely.

Now that we have studied the market outlook up until the end of 2024, let's take a look at some of the good stocks to buy right now.

We used a consensus-based approach and sifted through financial media reports to first compile a list of good stocks to buy right now. We then shortlisted and ranked these stocks by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

It owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Wyamo. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported solid earnings in the second quarter of 2024. Its CEO, Sundar Pichai suggests that its performance was largely driven by its growing momentum in search and clod. The company logged nearly $85 billion in revenue, of which search and cloud exceeded $10 billion for the first time in quarterly revenue. The company highlights that it is investing to innovate every layer of the AI stack. On the technology hardware front, its processing units currently account for almost 20% of the market, however, its advancements promise higher market shares in the future. In addition to that, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors and its new set of chips will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. The technology giant is well-positioned to benefit from the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as of Q2 2024, according to the Insider Monkey database. Patient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc.

We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple."" Overall GOOGL ranks 2nd among the 10 good stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

2024-10-18T13:07:18+00:00,Tesla’s self-driving cars investigated over safety in fog and bright sunlight,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-self-driving-cars-investigated-130718271.html,"US authorities are investigating millions of Tesla vehicles after reports that the company’s cars crashed in the fog or bright sunlight while they were in self-driving mode.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was examining whether the software used by 2.4m Tesla cars failed to respond properly in conditions where there was poor visibility.

The watchdog said it had identified four crashes where Tesla cars were driving using full self-driving (FSD) technology on roads with fog, sun-glare or dust.

In one incident, the Tesla killed a pedestrian and in another, a person was injured. The investigation applies to Tesla Model S cars built after 2016 as well as its Model 3, Model Y and Cybertruck.

Tesla’s electric cars are designed to allow self-driving on most US roads, with built-in cameras and autonomous driving software. The driver is supposed to be ready to take back control of the vehicle at all times. The technology is not available on UK roads.

Unlike rival self-driving carmakers, Tesla’s vehicles do not rely on expensive laser systems – known as Lidar – or radar signals to map the world around them. Instead, it uses cameras to build up a picture of its surroundings.

Experts have questioned whether Tesla’s approach of using cameras and AI software alone can be as accurate.

The regulator said it would be investigating “the ability of FSD’s engineering controls to detect and respond appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions”.

Tesla’s owner manuals warn that its self-driving software can suffer in areas of low visibility. The documents warn: “Low visibility, such as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc) can significantly degrade performance.”

In April, the US highways regulator warned that a “critical safety gap” in Tesla’s Autopilot, its driver-assistance system, contributed to 467 crashes. The watchdog said the cars failed to do enough to ensure the drivers paid attention to the road ahead. It added there was a “mismatch” between drivers’ expectations of the systems capabilities and how the autonomous driving technology worked in practice.

Tesla was forced into a software update on millions of its vehicles. However, the regulator questioned whether the changes were enough.

The investigation comes as Elon Musk, the chief executive, bets that Tesla’s autonomous vehicle software can fuel its future growth amid a global slowdown in demand for electric vehicles.

Last week, Tesla showed off a new robotaxi design: a self-driving vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals that Mr Musk hopes will go into mass production from 2026. Along with the two-door vehicle, Tesla also revealed a larger robovan, intended to carry up to 20 passengers.",GOOGL,yes,eod,537
2024-10-18T13:00:15+00:00,Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-goog-trending-stock-130015879.html,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this company have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +18.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

The consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.7%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. For Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.79 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $292.23 billion and $325.87 billion estimates indicate +13.9% and +11.5% changes, respectively. Alphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Alphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-10-18T09:59:36+00:00,Amazon and Alphabet: Pivotal Chooses the Best ‘Magnificent 7’ Stocks to Buy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-alphabet-pivotal-chooses-best-095936060.html,"The NASDAQ index has risen 24% year-to-date and is hovering near record highs following a summer lull. Once again, the rally has been powered largely by the ‘Magnificent 7’ – a select group of mega-cap tech stocks that have soared to stratospheric valuations in recent years.

This group includes the six largest stocks trading on Wall Street – Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta – as well as Elon Musk’s Tesla. Together, these companies have been leaders in innovation, especially of the AI tech that is so rapidly changing the tech world.

Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak has been closely examining the ‘Magnificent 7’ and is now offering fresh recommendations on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Let’s take a closer look at what makes these two stand out and why they are receiving Wlodarczak’s endorsement.

We’ll start with Amazon, the global leader in online retail. This company is a proven survivor, an original ‘dot.com’ that survived the tech bubble of the late 90s–early 2000s and has grown to become one of the world’s largest publicly traded firms. While the company started out as an online bookseller, today e-shoppers can find virtually anything on Amazon – and the company will guarantee delivery almost anywhere in the world.

Amazon backs up its huge inventory, covering everything from books and toys to pharmaceuticals, clothing, and phone cases, with a network of high-tech warehouses and logistics facilities. The company’s warehouses use AI and robotic tech, backed up by a human workforce, to pack and ship anything to anywhere.

This combination of huge inventory and fast delivery has made Amazon the world leader in e-commerce – and allowed the company to build up an enormous market cap of nearly $2 trillion, making Amazon the world’s fifth-largest public company. Amazon has used its deep pockets to expand its customer base by expanding its product and service offerings.

On the product side, Amazon has recently been pushing its ‘digital pharmacy’ business, allowing customers to fill prescriptions online, with fully accredited pharmacists. Earlier this month, the company announced that it will be opening 20 new pharmacies, doubling the number of cities with same-day delivery service available.

On the service side, the company’s cloud computing platform, AWS, has become increasingly popular. AWS, which is a direct competitor to Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure, has become an important revenue driver for Amazon – and accounted for $26.3 billion of the company’s $148 billion topline in Q2 of this year (the last quarter reported). That makes AWS responsible for almost 18% of the total revenue in a quarter that saw 10% year-over-year revenue growth. Amazon has been consistently reporting year-over-year quarterly revenue growth in the low double digits recently and is expected to do so again in the upcoming Q3 report. The top line for the third quarter is expected to exceed $157 billion, which would translate to another 10% year-over-year gain.

For analyst Wlodarczak, Amazon presents a solid tale of strength and growth. He writes of the company, “Amazon has a deep moat around their core businesses driven by their unmatched scale and has what appears to be the largest organic revenue growth opportunity of any mega cap tech company (other than arguably NVDA (N/R)) driven primarily by their AWS cloud segment (which we expect to grow from 17% of revenue to ~35% in 5 years), extension of their e-commerce/fulfillment arms into new segments/internationally, continued rapid growth in their advertising business and proven ability to develop new successful products/revenue streams.” Looking ahead, Wlodarczak goes on to explain why investors should continue to buy in on AMZN: “This is all enhanced by what we believe is the highest potential of their peers to materially boost operating margins driven by scale, leveraging robotics/AI and benefits from an increasing % of revenue from high margin cloud computing/advertising combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation.” As expected, after comments like these, Wlodarczak rates Amazon stock as a Buy. His price target, set at $260, points toward a one-year upside potential of 39%. (To watch Wlodarczak’s track record, click here) This major retailer/tech firm has picked up plenty of attention from Wall Street, and mostly all positive. The Strong Buy consensus is based on a lopsided Buy/Hold split of 45 to 2 among the analyst reviews, and the $224.38 average price target implies a 20% upside from the current trading price of $186.89. (See Amazon stock forecast) The second Mag 7 stock we’ll look at is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and the market’s fourth-largest public company, with a market cap of just over $2 trillion. Alphabet, which also owns YouTube and has been developing an ever-growing presence in the AI field, has built its success on its absolute dominance of the global internet search segment – and the advantages that brings in the field of digital advertising. Remember that Google and YouTube are the world’s leaders in online search and online video search, respectively. In the last few years, the AI boom has begun to shift the tech landscape in ways that are still not fully clear. Alphabet has been moving to adopt the new technology, seeing it as a multiplier for online search, and as a powerful tool in online and cloud-based applications. The company is using AI tech in its multimodal large language models, which improve both Google’s online translation apps and its search engine functionality. These improvements in generating search results and translation matrixes are a direct response to increased competition from Microsoft’s Bing as well as ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms. On the practical side, Alphabet has released its Gemini platform, its most up-to-date offering in AI. Gemini is based on a core of large language models, designed from the start to understand natural language content – in text, audio, images, video, and even in code. The platform uses AI to provide the maximum flexibility for the end user’s application, and Alphabet is working to integrate it into all of its products. That includes the Android operating system, which will make Gemini’s AI available on smartphones – and all of their apps. For Alphabet, the key challenge presented by AI will be maintaining market share in online search as the digital world switches its base to generative AI tools and apps. For now, Alphabet is generating solid revenue and income numbers. The company brought in $84.7 billion in 2Q24, a total that was up nearly 14% from the prior-year quarter and was more than $445 million over the forecast. Alphabet’s bottom line of $1.89 per share was 5 cents over expectations. Analysts are expecting to see revenues of $86.23 billion when the company reports earnings for Q3 later this month. Turning again to Pivotal’s Wlodarczak, we find the analyst taking an upbeat view of Alphabet’s stock, its position and prospects. He says, “If the status quo holds, GOOG appears to be in a very strong competitive position with a deep moat around their dominant core search business model (~90% market share ex China) and an obvious path to leverage 90%+ (ex China) global device presence (which we believe will dominate consumer AI assistant use), a strong AI platform and financial might to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement. GOOG also holds a strong #3 position in cloud computing, which we believe has dramatic growth potential…” Looking ahead, Wlodarczak adds, “This position is enhanced by the fact that GOOG appears to have the ability, leveraging their AI investment, to significantly reduce their cost structure (mainly through a material reduction in their ~180K employees) offset partially by the aforementioned potentially higher TAC to extend their search handset dominance to AI (if they are not prohibited in doing so by regulators/courts), which should help drive strong financial growth and help them generate a reasonable AI ROIC even if the development of AI revenue generating applications takes longer than expected.” It should come as no surprise that the Pivotal analyst rates GOOGL shares as a Buy, while his price target, $215, suggests an upside of 30% on the one-year horizon. For the Street generally, this is another stock with a Strong Buy consensus. The 39 recent reviews include 30 Buys to 9 Holds. Shares are priced at $165.16 and have an average target price of $201.57, implying a gain of 22% by this time next year.

2024-10-18T09:21:00+00:00,Billionaire Seth Klarman Sold 64% of Baupost's Stake in Alphabet and Is Piling Into This Historically Cheap and Under-the-Radar Drugmaker,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-seth-klarman-sold-64-092100626.html,"Earnings season has officially kicked off for Wall Street. Over a roughly six-week stretch, a majority of S&P 500 companies will report their operating results from the latest quarter and offer insight on the health of the U.S. economy and consumer.

But earnings season is far from the only important data dump investors are privy to each quarter.

On Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This invaluable filing allows investors to see what Wall Street's smartest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter.

To be transparent, 13Fs aren't perfect. They can be 45 days old, when filed, which means they're presenting stale information for active hedge funds. Nevertheless, 13Fs provide insight into which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's most-prominent asset managers.

The June-ended quarter was a particularly active period for billionaire Seth Klarman, the CEO and portfolio manager of Baupost Group. The value-focused Klarman, who's modeled his investment philosophy after Benjamin Graham, is overseeing $3.6 billion of invested assets spread across close to two dozen holdings.

Perhaps the most noteworthy move made by Klarman in the second quarter was to meaningfully pare down the cheapest of all ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). At the same time, Klarman willingly piled into an off-the-radar, but historically inexpensive, drug stock.

Klarman's Baupost jettisoned a significant portion of its stake in Alphabet

Baupost first initiated a position in Alphabet's Class C shares (GOOG) during the first quarter of 2020 (i.e., during the COVID-19 crash). As of March 31, Klarman's fund held north of 2.9 million shares. But over the course of three months, ended June 30, Baupost's investment leaders, including Klarman, sent 1,888,064 shares of Alphabet to the chopping block, representing a 64% reduction.

While profit-taking is a viable reason for Seth Klarman and his team to reduce their fund's stake in Google, YouTube, and Waymo parent Alphabet by nearly two-thirds, I believe there may four other possible explanations.

To start with, Klarman and his crew might be concerned about the stock market being historically pricey. The S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly referred to as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE ratio), hit its highest level of the year earlier this week (37.70), and has more than doubled its average reading of 17.16, dating back to January 1871. Even though Alphabet's forward P/E ratio is a reasonably low 19, the company's shares would undoubtedly be weighed down if the broad-market indexes were to roll over.

Alphabet's valuation might be another tipping point for Baupost's chief. Despite Alphabet's stock trading below its average forward P/E multiple over the last five years, it's pricier than its average book value over the last five years, and is no longer the screaming bargain it's been relative to its cash flow. Klarman tends to focus heavily on these traditional fundamental measures of value. A third possibility behind this aggressive selling activity in Alphabet's Class C stock is the potential for the U.S. to fall into a recession. The first notable decline in M2 money supply since the Great Depression, along with the longest yield-curve inversion in history, suggest the U.S. economy can stumble in the coming quarters. With Alphabet generating 76% of its net sales from advertising during the June-ended quarter, it would be susceptible to weakness if economic growth were to slow or shift into reverse. Lastly, Baupost Group's smartest investment minds may have foreseen legal troubles to come for Alphabet. Specifically, the U.S. Justice Department may seek a breakup of Alphabet due to its utter dominance of internet search. Uncertainty tends to be the enemy of investors. For what it's worth, I believe this is a decision Klarman will eventually regret. But with the stock market historically pricey and Klarman being an ardent value investor, this selling activity does makes sense. Klarman is scooping up shares of a jaw-droppingly cheap pharma stock On the other end of the spectrum, Klarman and his team added to nine of Baupost Group's existing positions during the second quarter. Arguably none of these purchases stands out more than drug developer Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ). During the June-ended quarter, Klarman oversaw the addition of 440,552 shares of Jazz, which increased his fund's stake in the company by 53% to 1,274,248 shares. As of the midpoint of 2024, Jazz Pharmaceuticals was Baupost's ninth-largest holding, worth $136 million. Jazz's oxybate franchise, which is comprised of Xyrem and Xywav (two therapies focused on treating sleep disorders), are what make the company tick. Xyrem was Jazz's blockbuster narcolepsy treatment, while Xywav is its next-generation sleep-disorder therapy. Xywav contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem, which makes it an ideal sleep-disorder therapy for people with cardiovascular concerns. Based on revenue through the first-half of 2024, Jazz's oxybate franchise is pacing $1.6 billion in sales for the current year. Jazz is also looking for its cannabidiol (CBD)-based therapy, Epidiolex (known as Epidyolex overseas), to eventually reach blockbuster status. Epidiolex was the crown jewel of the $7.2 billion GW Pharmaceuticals acquisition by Jazz in May 2021. It treats rare forms of epilepsy and has limited competition, which has paved a path to steady double-digit sales growth. Epidiolex looks to be on track to generate close to $900 million in full-year revenue in 2024. Furthermore, Jazz's oncology segment topped $1 billion in annual sales for the first time in 2023. Much of this growth was fueled by injectable therapy Rylaze, which is a treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Improved cancer-screening diagnostics and substantive pricing power should lift oncology segment sales to at least $1.1 billion this year. Despite steady long-term growth from all three facets of the company's drug portfolio, there's concern that Avadel Pharmaceuticals may eat into Jazz's dominance of the sleep disorder space. Avadel commercially launched Lumryz in the U.S. five months ago, which is a therapy that directly competes with Jazz's oxybate franchise in select indications. However, a strong argument can be made that these competitive concerns are fully baked in. Shares of Jazz are valued at a little over 5 times Wall Street's consensus earnings per share (EPS) forecast for 2025. This represents a 32% discount to the company's average forward P/E over the trailing-five-year period. What's more, Jazz Pharmaceuticals has a robust pipeline that currently features more than 30 clinical trials. While there are a handful of label expansion opportunities for Epidiolex, the company's future revolves around its oncology pipeline, which is targeting small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia, among other indications. Just a few wins among these 30-plus trials can be huge for Jazz. Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

Earlier this year, Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) released separate reports showing that neither company is on track to meet its climate goals by the end of the decade. They both blamed the same culprit: data centers.

Despite the environmental toll, experts say data and other artificial intelligence infrastructure will be the winners of AI’s next phase as companies seek to power their growing AI offerings.

While AI chips developed by companies such as Nvidia and AMD are crucial to the current phase of AI development, the broader data center industry is “very well positioned” to be at the center of the next phase of AI expansion, Tejas Dessai, director of research at Global X, told Quartz.



“Where I think you have the highest probability of naming winners is in the picks and shovels category — who’s building the infrastructure that’s going to power all this,” Rowan Trollope, chief executive of data platform Redis, told Quartz. “No matter who, what app, or what model wins, we sit in the middle and we make them all better.”

As companies deploy more AI clusters, there could be “an uptake in memory solutions, in storage solutions, in networking solutions,” Dessai said, followed by companies specialized in comprehensive data center solutions.

“Currently, the principle that many of these companies are operating with is: The more the number of chips that we can put together in terms of training these models, the smarter and smarter the outcome is that we can get out of these models,” Dessai said in a separate interview with Quartz.

But he says there are still “a lot of physical constraints” such as GPU clusters, which run on hundreds of thousands of chips. And data centers can take years to come online, meaning there is still some “running behind” when it comes to having enough capacity for AI workloads.

“We’re still very early in that cycle and you see companies like OpenAI trying to get access to data center capacity from anywhere and everywhere that they can find it,” Dessai said.

Sarah Friar, chief technology officer at OpenAI, reportedly told the startup’s shareholders that its partner and investor, Microsoft, was too slow at supplying it with enough computing power. After the company completed its $6.6 billion funding round, the startup’s leaders told some employees that it would start leaning less on Microsoft for data centers and AI chips, according to The Information, which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.

In the short to medium term, Dessai said he sees data centers remaining attractive to companies as construction increases and vacancy rates reach “an all-time low.”

“Companies are really wanting to buy pretty much any capacity that they can find their hands on,” Dessai said.

“Data is the big winning category,” Trollope said. “We don’t know who in the data category is going to win, but I think the incumbents have a really good shot.”

Microsoft, which set a goal in 2020 to be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade, said in May that its carbon emissions are almost 31% higher than when it set the commitment. The increase was mostly due to building data centers, it said, as well as hardware like semiconductors and servers.

Meanwhile, Google said in July that its carbon emissions have risen by 48% since 2019, and were up 13% year-over-year in 2023 — mostly because of data center energy consumption. The tech giant set a goal in 2021 to reach net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030.

By the end of the decade, data centers could consume up to 9% of electricity in the U.S. — more than double what is being used now, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

In April, Ami Badani, chief marketing officer of British chip designer Arm, said data centers powering AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT account for 2% of global electricity consumption. One query on ChatGPT needs almost 10 times as much electricity as a Google search, according to a study by Goldman Sachs (GS). That level of energy demand, Badani said, could eventually slow down AI progress.

Tech giants are seemingly taking note of this obstacle. In July, the Wall Street Journal reported that a third of the U.S.’s nuclear power plants were discussing deals with tech companies to supply electricity for data centers.

“We have to make up for this energy deficit in one way or another,” Dessai said. “We can’t burn more coal, we can’t use more fossil fuels. So naturally nuclear energy becomes the answer to it.”

As big tech seems to be moving toward nuclear energy, “we’ll continue to see more deals in that direction,” he said.

Earlier this week, Google announced that it was signing “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy” from Small Modular Reactors, or SMRs, developed by California-based Kairos Power.

Google said it expects to bring Kairos Power’s first SMR online by the end of the decade, and others are planned through 2035. Through the deal, 500 megawatts (MW) of 24/7 carbon-free power will be available to U.S. electricity grids.

Amazon (AMZN) also signed agreements this week “to support the development of nuclear energy projects,” including by building “several” SMRs which have “a smaller physical footprint, allowing them to be built closer to the grid,” the company said. Compared to traditional reactors, the smaller SMRs can come online faster due to lower construction time, according to Amazon.

In September, Constellation Energy (CEG), which owns most of the country’s power plants, announced a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft. The deal will restart the Unit 1 reactor on Three Mile Island, and launch the Crane Clean Energy Center. The CCEC, which is expected to come online by 2028, will add more than 800 MW of carbon-free electricity to the power grid, a study by the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council found.

2024-10-18T08:02:00+00:00,"Meet the Unstoppable Growth Stock That Could Join Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club by 2028.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-unstoppable-growth-stock-could-080200866.html,"It was a mere 20 years ago that industrial and energy titans General Electric and ExxonMobil were the world's most valuable companies when measured by market cap, with values of $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Now, just two decades later, technology interests lead the field.

Heading up the list are some of the world's most familiar technology names. Apple tops the charts at $3.5 trillion (as of this writing). Nvidia and Microsoft are trailing close behind, with market caps of $3.2 trillion and $3.1 trillion, respectively.

With a market cap of just $2 trillion, it might seem a bit early to suggest that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has the makings for membership in the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 88% since early last year and 172% over the past five years, and there's every reason to believe its ascent will continue.

A combination of an improving economy, Alphabet's market strength, and gains in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) could provide the boost the company needs to join this exclusive society.

The widespread challenges of the past few years have been glaringly obvious, marked by macroeconomic headwinds and the worst inflation rates since the early 1980s. These conditions weighed heavily on each of Alphabet's major business segments and the stock plunged as much as 44% in response.

However, there's been a marked improvement in recent months. In September, the Federal Reserve Bank cut interest rates for the first time since March 2020, and consumer confidence jumped to its highest level in months.

The economic rebound has had a dramatic effect on Alphabet's results. In the second quarter, revenue of $84.7 billion climbed 14% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.89 jumped 31%.

Each of the company's major operating segments did their part to boost the results. The rebound in advertising, which has suffered the most in recent years, had the most profound impact. Google advertising, which provides the bulk of Alphabet's revenue, climbed 11% year over year, while Google Cloud -- the company's fastest-growing segment -- jumped 29%.

An industry leader -- in more ways than one

Google has long been the undisputed leader in search, recently capturing 90% of the search market, according to internet statistics aggregator StatCounter. The company has worked to consistently improve its search acumen and the underlying algorithms, becoming something of an AI subject matter expert along the way.

It's also the undisputed leader in digital advertising, fueled primarily by Google Search and YouTube but also by its suite of products that count billions of users each. In 2023, Google captured an estimated 39% of worldwide digital advertising revenue, according to data compiled by Statista. For context, its closest competitor -- Meta Platforms -- garnered just 18%. This dominance is expected to continue. Alphabet is also a strong contender in the realm of cloud computing. Google Cloud is part of the ""Big Three"" as the third-largest provider of cloud infrastructure services. The company controlled roughly 10% of the market in the second quarter, according to data supplied by Canalys. It was also the fastest-growing, with year-over-year revenue growth of 30%. Helping fuel demand for Google Cloud is the company's generative AI offerings. Alphabet has been using AI for years to inform its search results, and the company has refocused that expertise to fuel a suite of AI-powered models led by Gemini, one of the leading foundational AI models in the world. This is attracting new users to Google Cloud. I'd be remiss if I didn't address the elephant in the room. The antitrust case against Alphabet is one step closer to completion. The court found that Google had violated antitrust law, and the U.S. Justice Department is mulling recommendations regarding the appropriate remedies, though the judge will have the final say. One of the potential outcomes is a breakup of the company, which is something that hasn't happened in decades. There are other less severe proposals, like sharing Google's search code with rivals, blocking other providers from paying Google to be its default search engine and more. A final decision won't be reached for at least a year, and if Alphabet appeals (it says it will), the case could go on for several more. Wall Street hates uncertainty, so this has been an overhang for Alphabet stock in recent months. All that aside, even if Alphabet were to be broken up -- and I don't believe it will -- that could unlock additional value, enriching shareholders along the way. So, the current concerns are merely noise, in my opinion. Alphabet currently boasts a market cap of roughly $2 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of about 47% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Alphabet is expected to generate revenue of $347.4 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Alphabet would have to grow its revenue to roughly $510 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap. Wall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Alphabet of about 11% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as early as 2028. It's worth noting that Alphabet has grown its annual revenue by 368% over the past decade, so Wall Street could be lowballing its forecast. Furthermore, Alphabet is currently selling for roughly 24 times earnings, a significant discount compared to the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500. The aforementioned uncertainty is providing a very attractive entry point for savvy investors who plan to buy and hold for the long term. Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

What Happened: “There’s millions of Teslas out there that are constantly alerting, feeding back their data to Tesla to make the product better, and that’s ultimately what’s really going to be the differentiator here — that you have the richest, most consistent data to continuously improve over time,” Levandowski said in an interview with Business Insider.

“I’d rather be in Tesla’s shoes than in Waymo’s shoes.”
• The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.

Tesla uses camera footage from its existing fleet of vehicles to train its software aimed at enabling autonomous driving. Tesla’s fleet is significantly large and operates across the country as compared to Waymo which is only operating vehicles in a select few cities within the U.S. such as Phoenix and San Francisco.

Tesla, therefore, likely has much more data than Waymo across scenarios of driving to train its tech, the Waymo co-founder opined.

Why It Matters: Tesla unveiled its dedicated robotaxi offerings last week at an event in Los Angeles. The company unveiled two products – a two-seater Cybercab and a 20-seater Robovan with no steering wheels or pedals. The Cybercab, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, will enter production “before 2027.”

Waymo, meanwhile, already operates robotaxis in select cities. The company deploys its sensor suite on vehicles manufactured by other automakers, such as Jaguar vehicles, for use as robotaxis, which by itself is a cost-extensive process.

“You probably need to buy a car company to be able to produce the cars that you want,” Levandowski reportedly said regarding Waymo. He left Waymo in 2016 after co-founding it in 2009.

The search giant is simplifying its structure to “keep increasing the pace of progress” of AI development, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said in a blog post on Thursday. He also announced that Prabhakar Raghavan, the most senior leader of Google’s search and ads units, is leaving the role after four years helming the company’s flagship businesses. Raghavan will step into a new role as Google’s chief technologist, Pichai said.

Nick Fox, a veteran Google executive who acted as a search deputy under Raghavan, will step into the role leading the company’s search, ads, maps and shopping services.

Long the dominant search engine globally, Google has battled the perception for the last two years that it’s lagged behind the likes of Microsoft, OpenAI and other startups in rolling out new generative AI tools and services. Yet, as it works to stay competitive with new entrants upending search, it must also take care not to cannibalize its core profit machine. In his announcement, Pichai framed the reorganization as a way to streamline the company’s progress in artificial intelligence.

Over the last six months, Google has been consolidating its AI-focused teams, seeking to improve the Gemini models to challenge the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. In April, the firm moved its models, research and responsible AI teams to the DeepMind division. Soon after, it merged DeepMind with Google Brain, a rival research unit within the company.

DeepMind was founded in London in 2010 as an academic-style research lab, then acquired by Google in 2014. Executives say the lab has recently shifted away from its original mission and become more product-driven.

Both inside and outside Google, “so many of the leading research labs are actually product companies at this point,” said Eli Collins, DeepMind’s vice president of product, in an interview with Bloomberg News last month. He said DeepMind has had to “pick up the pace” to keep up with the rate of AI innovation.

Google has also been challenged by mounting antitrust scrutiny from federal officials. In August, Google lost a trial over claims by the US Justice Department that the company illegally monopolizes online search and advertising markets. In September, a trial covering the company’s alleged dominance over the technology used to buy and sell online ads concluded, with closing arguments scheduled for November. A decision in that case is expected by the end of the year.",GOOGL,yes,eod,583

2024-10-17T18:19:21+00:00,Tech firms remove social media accounts of a Russian drone factory after an AP investigation,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-firms-remove-social-media-181921352.html,"Google, Meta and TikTok have removed social media accounts belonging to an industrial plant in Russia's Tatarstan region aimed at recruiting young foreign women to make drones for Moscow's war in Ukraine.

Posts on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok were taken down following an investigation by The Associated Press published Oct. 10 that detailed working conditions in the drone factory in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, which is under U.S. and British sanctions.

Videos and other posts on the social media platforms promised the young women, who are largely from Africa, a free plane ticket to Russia and a salary of more than $500 a month following their recruitment via the program called “Alabuga Start.”

But instead of a work-study program in areas like hospitality and catering, some of them said they learned only arriving in the Tatarstan region that they would be toiling in a factory to make weapons of war, assembling thousands of Iranian-designed attack drones to be launched into Ukraine.

In interviews with AP, some of the women who worked in the complex complained of long hours under constant surveillance, of broken promises about wages and areas of study, and of working with caustic chemicals that left their skin pockmarked and itching. AP did not identify them by name or nationality out of concern for their safety.

The tech companies also removed accounts for Alabuga Polytechnic, a vocational boarding school for Russians aged 16-18 and Central Asians aged 18-22 that bills its graduates as experts in drone production.

The accounts collectively had at least 158,344 followers while one page on TikTok had more than a million likes.

In a statement, YouTube said its parent company Google is committed to sanctions and trade compliance and ""after review and consistent with our policies, we terminated channels associated with Alabuga Special Economic Zone.”

Meta said it removed accounts on Facebook and Instagram that “violate our policies.” The company said it was committed to complying with sanctions laws and said it recognized that human exploitation is a serious problem which required a multifaceted approach, including at Meta.

It said it had teams dedicated to anti-trafficking efforts and aimed to remove those seeking to abuse its platforms.

TikTok said it removed videos and accounts which violated its community guidelines, which state it does not allow content that is used for the recruitment of victims, coordination of their transport, and their exploitation using force, fraud, coercion, or deception.

The women aged 18-22 were recruited to fill an urgent labor shortage in wartime Russia. They are from places like Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, as well as the South Asian country of Sri Lanka. The drive also is expanding to elsewhere in Asia as well as Latin America. Accounts affiliated to Alabuga with tens of thousands of followers are still accessible on Telegram, which did not reply to a request for comment. The plant's management also did not respond to AP. The Alabuga Start recruiting drive used a robust social media campaign of slickly edited videos with upbeat music that show African women smiling while cleaning floors, wearing hard hats while directing cranes, and donning protective equipment to apply paint or chemicals. Videos also showed them enjoying Tatarstan's cultural sites or playing sports. None of the videos made it clear the women would be working in a drone manufacturing complex. Online, Alabuga promoted visits to the industrial area by foreign dignitaries, including some from Brazil, Sri Lanka and Burkina Faso. In a since-deleted Instagram post, a Turkish diplomat who visited the plant had compared Alabuga Polytechnic to colleges in Turkey and pronounced it “much more developed and high-tech."" According to Russian investigative outlets Protokol and Razvorot, some pupils at Alabuga Polytechnic are as young as 15 and have complained of poor working conditions. Videos previously on the platforms showed the vocational school students in team-building exercises such as “military-patriotic” paintball matches and recreating historic Soviet battles while wearing camouflage. Last month, Alabuga Start said on Telegram its ""audience has grown significantly!” That could be due to its hiring of influencers, who promoted the site on TikTok and Instagram as an easy way for young women to make money after leaving school. TikTok removed two videos promoting Alabuga after publication of the AP investigation. Experts told AP that about 90% of the women recruited via the Alabuga Start program work in drone manufacturing.",GOOGL,yes,eod,907

2024-10-17T18:04:45+00:00,"AAPL, MSFT, or GOOGL: Which Tech Company is the Better Buy this Earnings Season?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aapl-msft-googl-tech-company-180445275.html,"As earnings season approaches for big technology companies, I will compare Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) using the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to determine which stock is the best buy. While I hold a neutral outlook on Apple and a bullish outlook on both Microsoft and Alphabet, a closer analysis suggests that Microsoft may be the best choice heading into earnings.

I hold a neutral stance on Apple ahead of its earnings report on Oct. 31. My skepticism is due to what I view as overly optimistic revisions from Wall Street analysts, with 21 out of 25 raising earnings per share (EPS) estimates and 21 out of 24 boosting revenue projections over the past three months. The consensus expects EPS of $1.55 (up 6% year-over-year) and revenues of $94.23 billion (up 5.3%).

While the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, both capable of running artificial intelligence (AI), are key to Apple’s growth, initial sales of 37 million units fell 12.7% below the iPhone 15’s launch figures. The full potential of these devices, however, may not be realized until more AI features become available, delaying any AI-driven super cycle.

Apple’s performance in China will also be important this earnings season. Over the last nine months, Apple’s sales in China have dropped by 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in Fiscal Q3 compared to last year, reflecting a downward trend. While there was an expectation of demand recovery in Fiscal Q4 due to the iPhone 16 launch, the full impact is likely to materialize over the coming year when AI-driven updates become available.

Additionally, Apple’s Services segment should continue to post record revenues, benefiting from Apple’s ecosystem of 2.2 billion active iOS devices.

I rate Apple as a Hold ahead of its earnings, though I expect near-term growth to sustain the stock’s momentum, which is trading near all-time highs. Despite this, I see few catalysts that will enable the company to surpass the upwardly revised expectations.

Moreover, Apple’s options chains reflects some volatility, with an expected price swing ahead of earnings of 4.7% in either direction based on an at-the-money $230 strike price for options expiring on Nov. 1. The chart below illustrates the options chain.

At TipRanks, Apple’s Wall Street consensus is a Moderate Buy, with 23 out of 34 analysts recommending investors Buy the stock. The average price target is $248.90, suggesting potential upside of 7.99%.

I am bullish on Microsoft leading into earnings scheduled for Oct. 30. Despite beating expectations across the board with its previous financial results, that print did not positively impact MSFT stock. And, analysts have revised their projections downward for the upcoming Fiscal Q1 2025 earnings.

In the past three months, 15 of 21 analysts have lowered their EPS estimates, and all 26 have revised revenue projections for Fiscal Q1. Current expectations are for EPS of $3.10 (a 3.7% year-over-year increase) and revenues of $64.54 billion (up 14.2%). Last quarter, a major concern that hurt Microsoft was the announcement of increased infrastructure spending to meet growing demand. This spending is expected to pressure margins in the current Fiscal year. Additionally, the performance of the Intelligent Cloud segment, led by Azure, showed some moderation, with Azure growing by 22% year-over-year in the previous quarter. These revised estimates present a more tempered view, giving Microsoft an opportunity to meet or exceed expectations with its upcoming results. I rate Microsoft a Buy ahead of its earnings, believing that with lower expectations and more patient investors, the company’s strong cloud performance and sustained gross margins near 70% should be better appreciated. This could help the stock return to its all-time high of $468 per share reached in July of this year. However, the options chain below indicates significant volatility, with an expected price swing of 5.9% ahead of earnings, based on the at-the-money straddle for options expiring on Nov. 1, at a strike price of $412.50. At TipRanks, Microsoft has a Strong Buy rating from Wall Street, with 26 of 29 analysts rating it a Buy and an average price target of $503.13, suggesting potential upside of 21.84%. I have a positive outlook for Alphabet ahead of its Q3 earnings report on Oct. 29, as Wall Street expectations seem balanced and the company may exceed conservative guidance. Analysts have made 17 upward and 18 downward EPS revisions, along with 16 upward and 13 downward revenue revisions in the past three months. The target to beat is an EPS of $1.84 (up 19% year-over-year) and revenues of $86.23 billion (up 12.4% year-over-year). While Alphabet’s Q2 results beat expectations, YouTube’s ad revenue of $8.66 billion fell short of the $8.93 billion consensus, contributing to the mixed revisions. Management also cautioned that operating margins could be impacted by increased depreciation, higher infrastructure costs, and the pull-forward of hardware launches. Despite concerns about losing market share in Search due to rising AI competition, Google Search showed steady growth in this year’s second quarter, with double-digit growth expected to continue. Any potential weaknesses in YouTube or Search can be offset by Google Cloud, which experienced a 29% revenue increase in Q2, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of growth. I rate Alphabet as a Buy ahead of its earnings, as the stock has fallen nearly 13% since its Q2 report, which I believe to be somewhat of an overreaction. Alphabet appears well-positioned to deliver strong performance for the third quarter, supported by a more balanced market outlook. Compared to Apple and Microsoft, Alphabet’s options chains below shows the lowest volatility ahead of earnings. The expected price swing is 2.8% in either direction, based on the at-the-money straddle for options expiring on Nov. 1, calculated using a $165 strike price. According to TipRanks, Alphabet is rated a Strong Buy, with 39 analysts recommending Buy and nine recommending Hold. The average price target is $200.92, indicating potential upside of 21.48%. While analysts are revising estimates upward for Apple, making it harder to beat expectations in a transitional quarter, softer expectations for Microsoft and Alphabet create a better outlook for earnings beats. Though I consider both MSFT and GOOGL to be Buys, I believe Microsoft is the stronger choice as its stock likely has more room to run and it could easily beat modest earnings expectations.",GOOGL,yes,eod,1375
2024-10-17T17:12:18+00:00,"Amazon, Google Join Nuclear Power Push, Triggering Market Surge",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-google-join-nuclear-power-171218606.html,"The Uranium stocks have popped as significant tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN, Financial), Microsoft (MSFT, Financial), and Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial) deepen their nuclear power bets. It started with Microsoft's power purchase agreement made last month that will revamp the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station for AI's burgeoning growth.

This week, we saw the spectrum shifting a gear higher as a giant such as Amazon revealed partnerships with Energy Northwest, Dominion Energy, and X-energy to pursue Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which have thus brightened up investor confidence in the sector. On the same day, Google's parent company Alphabet was revealed to be investing $10 million in Kairos Power to develop the initial 500MW of advanced small modular reactor facilities, all in a sign of a sector switching to more compact and environmentally friendly power generation technology.

The market confronting them responded sharply and violently. New interesting information about uranium mining and nuclear energy Company Cameco (CCJ, Financial) rocketed 8.2%, Denison Mines (DNN, Financial) and Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE, Financial) went 14.7 % per share higher and 17% higher, respectively. NuScale Power (SMR, Financial, which was revealed earlier had a large stake in the SMR market, rocketed up by a magnificent 31.6% and reached its highest point ever.

The enthusiasm for nuclear power is underpinned by the IAEA's latest forecasts on nuclear capability, which indicate a probability of a 2.5-fold increase in capacity by 2050. This projection is in line with the rising global push to escalate nuclear deployment as part of the plan to realize net-zero carbon emissions.

Closely following this, tech giants set the pace, investing in nuclear power. They did not merely ignite the upturn of relevant stocks, but they also indicated nuclear energy as a crucial factor that could shape the future energy scenario, generating a cleaner and more sustainable energy mix.

2024-10-17T15:42:00+00:00,"Google and Apple's exclusive search engine deal could be on the DOJ's chopping block, analysts say",https://www.yahoo.com/tech/key-search-deal-between-apple-143400705.html,"Google and Apple's exclusive search engine deal could be on the DOJ's chopping block, analysts say

The Department of Justice could block Google (GOOGL) from being the default search engine on Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone as part of its antitrust victory against the tech giant.



In August, a federal judge ruled that Google monopolized the online search engine market. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF) said a “very likely” outcome could be that the Justice Department will opt to ban Google from paying Apple to be the exclusive search engine on the popular smartphone.

That could pose a major blow to Apple’s revenues. According to the analysts’ estimates, revenue from this deal is around $25 billion for the year, or about 6.3% of Apple’s revenue and a whopping 20% of its pretax profit.

This ban could take place over the course of several years and may not altogether prevent Google from having any revenue-sharing agreement with Apple. Instead, it would block the two tech giants from having an exclusive deal that would shut out other search engines.



Apple stock was flat as of Thursday morning, trading at $231.96 per share. The tech giant has a market capitalization of $3.52 trillion — the largest in the world.

Federal judge Amit Mehta said in his decision that Google’s exclusive agreements with companies like Apple allowed it to hike prices for advertisers without any blowback.

To address Google’s monopoly in the search engine market, the Justice Department said in a court filing earlier this month that it’s looking for remedies that would prevent and restrain any present and future maintenance of its dominance.

This would include “behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features” — which could also mean breaking up the company.

While the ruling and subsequent DOJ proposals have knock-on effects on the iPhone maker, Apple stock was largely unharmed by the ruling. Jefferies noted that the sales performance of the recently released iPhone 16 and rollout of its artificial intelligence features, Apple Intelligence, are more important short-term drivers.

The analysts said they are worried that market expectations for next year’s iPhone, the iPhone 17, are too high and that AI hardware tech on smartphones may have to wait until the iPhone 18 in 2026 to be fully developed.

2024-10-17T15:33:00+00:00,Amazon Earnings Preview: The Weakest of the Magnificent 7?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-earnings-preview-weakest-magnificent-153300550.html,"Of all the Magnificent 7 stocks, Amazon (AMZN) has been the most challenging for investors to own over the last several years. While all the other companies in the group excluding Tesla are trading significantly higher than their 2021 highs, Amazon languishes. Amazon’s stock price is at the same price as it was in July 2021. May this lack of progress in the stock price be an opportunity for discerning investors?

Amazon's stock has moved sideways over the past three years, allowing its valuation to become increasingly attractive as the company’s earnings have continued to grow. This period of stagnation in share price, combined with steady profit and sales growth, appears to have positioned the stock at a more appealing level for investors.

Today, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions. However, with its historically cheap valuation and strong growth forecasts, it may be an attractive addition to investors’ portfolios. Amazon reports earnings Thursday, October 24. This analysis will examine the upcoming earnings expectations for Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing segments, as well as the potential impact of artificial intelligence on the business, to assess whether the stock presents a worthwhile investment opportunity. We will also compare Amazon to two other Magnificent 7 members – Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).

Despite the less than encouraging stock price action, Amazon has continuously posted strong earnings over the past year. During the last four quarterly earnings meetings, Amazon has beaten analysts’ expectations every time with an average beat of 31.13%. Although the Zacks earnings ESP is not projecting an earnings beat this quarter, earnings are projected to grow nicely nonetheless, and sales are expected to progress nicely as well.

Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, continues to dominate the highly competitive cloud services market, and last quarter reported a $100 billion annual revenue run rate. Most notably, web services revenue growth has been reaccelerating and shows continued expansion in margins. Artificial intelligence is and will continue to be a major catalyst for AWS, as its intense demand for computing power should power more growth in the years ahead.

Regarding the retail business, analysts are expecting close to double digit year over year growth although there are still some concerns. Expanding internationally offers growth opportunities for Amazon but also brings challenges, including the negative impact of currency fluctuations on e-commerce results, especially with the strong dollar putting pressure on profitability. Additionally, competition is intensifying as traditional retailers like Walmart and Target enhance their e-commerce capabilities, while regional rivals such as MercadoLibre, Flipkart, and Alibaba pose significant threats in key international markets.

Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all major players in the cloud computing space, with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, respectively. While AWS leads the market share, both Azure and Google Cloud have been rapidly expanding their capabilities, with Alphabet leveraging its AI expertise and Microsoft integrating cloud services with its software ecosystem. In terms of valuation, Alphabet appears attractively priced at 21.6x forward earnings, which is below its five-year median of 23.8x. Microsoft, on the other hand, trades at a higher valuation of 32x forward earnings, above its five-year median of 22.3x. Meanwhile, Amazon is trading at 38.5x forward earnings, significantly lower than its five-year median of 70.1x, suggesting potential value as the stock has lagged despite continued growth in earnings and cloud revenues. Amazon's stock has been challenging for investors over the past several years, especially compared to other ""Magnificent 7"" stocks. While companies like Alphabet and Microsoft have climbed well beyond their 2021 highs, Amazon's stock price is still languishing around the same level as it was in mid-2021. This lack of progress could be an opportunity for patient investors who see potential in the company's evolving business and improving valuation. Despite stagnant stock performance, Amazon's valuation has become more attractive as earnings and revenues have continued to grow. AMZN has also spawned multibillion dollar new businesses like Advertising, Alexa and Prime video which continue to grow nicely and give another reason to never count this technology juggernaut out of the race. As Amazon heads into its earnings report on October 24, key segments to watch include e-commerce, where nearly double-digit growth is expected, and Amazon Web Services, which continues to lead the cloud computing market. And while of course risks remain, Amazon's steady business growth, attractive valuation, and leading cloud position make it worth considering for investors willing to look beyond short-term challenges.

The analysts cite growing confidence in Zoom's enterprise business, stabilizing churn, and new opportunities in the contact center segment as key reasons for the optimistic outlook.

""We are upgrading our rating...as the company expects to see a re-acceleration in growth across enterprise customers while seeing its churn stabilize,"" Wedbush wrote.

Wedbush notes that Zoom's core products are now unified via its communications platform, Zoom One, which integrates meetings, phone, chat, and more.

Wedbush believes the company's broad product portfolio enables ""strong upsell and cross-sell opportunities,"" with customers increasingly subscribing to multiple products.

Notably, Wedbush says 13% of enterprise customers now use three or more Zoom products, contributing 66% of the company's total annual recurring revenue (ARR).

The firm highlights promising growth in Zoom's expansion into the contact center segment. While the contact center product (CCaaS) is on a slower growth path compared to the earlier success of Zoom Phone, Wedbush believes it will still hit a $400 million run rate within four years.

Zoom Phone ""took ~4.5 years from launch to reach ~10% of revenues, but this might take slightly longer with ZM representing a much larger revenue base while expecting solid upside as it tracks closely with Zoom Phone, making it likely to reach ~$400 million run rate in ~4 years after launch"" noted Wedbush.

Wedbush also said Zoom's churn rate has improved to 2.9% after stricter payment enforcement. The stability is expected to drive enterprise revenue growth throughout the second half of 2025 and accelerate into fiscal 2026.

""Churn decreased...bringing more stability to its net retention rate,"" the firm states.

Despite growing competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Workspace, and other UCaaS providers, Wedbush sees Zoom well-positioned to address a $235 billion addressable market by 2028.

2024-10-17T14:32:37+00:00,Google Flights adds a ‘cheapest’ tab in a huge assist to bargain hunters everywhere,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-flights-adds-cheapest-tab-143237102.html,"Flying from point A to point B can take a bite out of your wallet, sometimes a big one. Google, for years, has let you compare prices via its Google Flights tool, but now the site is taking things a step further.

Google Flights has added a “cheapest” tab, letting would-be travelers find the rock-bottom fare to their preferred destination. Saving cash sometimes comes at a cost, though. To get the cheapest flight, you’ll have to be willing to brave a red-eye travel schedule, change planes, and sometimes even change carriers mid-flight.

The tab is visible to mobile users of the tool. Once you search for a flight, you’ll be given the “best” options, based on price and convenience, per usual. But to the right is the “cheapest” tab, which will focus solely on price.

“Sometimes, there might be cheaper options available for those of you who are willing to give up some convenience for the best deal,” Google said in a blog post. “For example, there could be a third-party booking site offering a lower price than the airline itself. Or you might be able to save by flying back to a different airport that’s in the same city you departed from—like flying out of New York’s LaGuardia and returning to JFK.”

The tab will roll out globally over the next two weeks.

Even Google admits some of the low-cost itineraries can be “creative,” but if you’re flying on a budget, those inconveniences might be worth it to you.

Cheap flights are increasingly hard to come by. Over the past year, the consumer price index for airlines tickets has jumped 25%, the largest increase since the Federal Reserve of St. Louis began tracking prices in 1989.

2024-10-17T13:54:03+00:00,First US auction of nature-based carbon credits scheduled for early 2025,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-us-auction-of-nature-based-carbon-credits-scheduled-for-early-2025-135403332.html,"The American Forest Foundation (AFF) recently announced that the nonprofit will hold the US's first nature-based carbon credit auction early next year.

In February 2025, buyers will be able to bid on premium carbon credits from four projects under the Family Forest Carbon Program, an initiative that connects landowners with technical and financial resources to more sustainably manage private forest lands.

""We are trying to address several pain points that exist in the current voluntary market for buyers of carbon credits, but also for landowners who are seeking to participate in the market,"" Nate Truitt, executive vice president of climate funding at the American Forest Foundation, told Yahoo Finance. ""And we're also seeking to close what is a really substantial financing gap for natural climate solutions, a gap that we're going to have to close globally if we're going to stay on a 1.5- or even a two-degree scenario.""

Price volatility, market inefficiency, and a credibility crisis in the voluntary carbon market — along with the AI boom and other factors — have contributed to the recent trend of companies pulling back from their net-zero pledges. Corporations such as Shell (SHEL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Crocs (CROX) have missed, delayed, or weakened their sustainability targets in recent years.

Truitt expects interest in the auction from companies in sectors such as consumer goods that produce high emissions or are relatively less active in carbon markets but have decarbonization strategies in place. He also anticipates some interest from universities.

Among companies purchasing carbon credits, Microsoft dominates after setting an ambitious goal in 2020 to become carbon-negative within a decade. Other Big Tech firms such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are consistent buyers. However, Truitt doesn't expect Big Tech companies to ultimately participate in this auction as they already employ large procurement teams.

Truitt instead sees the auction as attracting ""the next wave of carbon credit buyers,"" comprised of actors that currently must navigate confusing spot markets, sift through individual carbon credit offerings, or sign on to long-term purchase agreements in a largely unregulated market.

“It's our hope that by lowering these transaction costs and the friction of this, ... we can get some of those buyers to come to the table,” Truitt said.

AFF is auctioning carbon credits for two types of projects. The first aims to improve forest management and carbon sequestration on 90,000 acres of land from Maine to Alabama held by 700 family landowners enrolled in the project. The second and newer type of project pays cattle ranchers and pasture owners in Georgia to plant trees on 1,500 acres of land.

Another feature of AFF's auction will be an advance funding mechanism. In addition to bidding on the number and price of carbon credits to be delivered at a later date, companies will determine a percentage they are willing to pay for up-front in exchange for a discount. Buyers have spent roughly $3 billion on durable carbon removal credits since October 2019, according to reporting platform CDR.fyi; however, the market could grow more rapidly with better access to low-cost financing. Truitt underscored that many projects are ready to get off the ground. But because these projects involve more risk — natural disasters and changing rules around offsets add to uncertainty — they often have a difficult time securing lending. If successful, AFF hopes its auction design can be used by other carbon market participants and remove barriers to these transactions. ""We're not solving climate change, but we're trying to develop a tool that will enable the voluntary carbon market to scale quicker and to produce higher-quality carbon credits that can be trusted by buyers, investors, and the general public,"" Truitt said. A person walks along a walking trail at Blackwater Woods in the New Forest National Park on Jan. 12, 2024, in Brockenhurst, United Kingdom. (Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images) Tim Stout is one landowner participating in the project. Stout and his family own a 175-acre former dairy farm in Vermont that was passed down from his great-grandfather. He and his brother have managed the heavily forested property for the past 40 years, and after evaluating different carbon projects, their family enrolled in the Family Forest Carbon Program. The financial benefits are ""fairly modest,"" Stout said. ""I mean, over 20 years, it's a healthy amount,"" he clarified, ""but I think for ... the program to really take off, the price of carbon credits has to go way up."" AFF said it uses Verra's verified carbon standard and its own internal methodology developed with the Nature Conservancy to vet the quality of the credits. ""A messy forest is better than a clean forest because … all the downed trees, all the branches, all the leaf litter is storing carbon,"" Stout explained about how these plans have changed the way he and his family manage their land. ""We're moving more and more to kind of a messy forest."" At the same time, the cost of managing land has ""gone up significantly,"" Stout said. Extreme weather attributed to climate change has exacerbated costs. Heavy rainfall and flooding in Vermont, which experienced a 1-in-1,000-year rain event this summer, eroded the foundation of Stout's barn, incurring a large expense, he said. And strong winds toppled 200-year-old maple trees onto roadways, which needed to be removed.

(Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) Funding from the auction will go toward expenses related to managing the forest and creating long-term land use plans that are developed by landowners, state foresters, and consulting AFF foresters. These plans and smart forestry techniques help forest owners like Stout increase the amount of carbon their forests can sequester. Stout, who now sits on AFF's board, said he was motivated to sign a contract with the Family Forest Carbon Program by his concerns over climate change. He also feels a strong calling to preserve the woodland for future generations and educate other small landowners about sustainable forestry. ""I would love to have my 4-year-old grandson and 2-year-old granddaughter be able to visit that [land] when they're my age and have a healthy, robust, resilient forest that's still playing a role in mitigating climate change,"" he said.

2024-10-17T13:00:20+00:00,This Analyst Predicted AI Will Crush Alphabet (GOOG) Search Business — Was He Right?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyst-predicted-ai-crush-alphabet-130020611.html,"We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Wall Street continues to gain momentum amid the latest earnings season and analysts are wondering whether we are still up for soft landing. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said:

“I think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.”

The analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however.

“My probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it’s not dominant. Why isn’t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan—at the end of July, the Fed didn’t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it’s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.”

For this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

In April 2023, Malcolm Ethridge, CIC Wealth executive vice president, on CNBC talked about the threats to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) search business and the defensive posture of Sundar Pichai when it comes to AI.

“I feel like Google (Alphabet) will be continuously distracted and continuously trying to catch up in this AI arms race. If Google were to lean too far into the generative AI search trend, it would cannibalize too much of their business, as search is their only real revenue source. Even the products they have developed are built around getting users to the search bar quicker than on their competitors’ devices.

So far the analyst’s concerns have proved wrong. Why? Despite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine’s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google’s market share. Cloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. Oakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-based communication services company’s stock price fell after a U.S. District Court ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining a monopoly in general search engine services via exclusive distribution agreements. We think this case is unlikely to hurt Alphabet’s valuation over the long term as regulations previously en[1]acted in the European Union to address similar issues did not materially erode the company’s market share. We continue to believe that Alphabet is an attractive investment.” Overall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The firm contends that the quarter will come in line or slightly better than expected, fueled by healthy user engagement across Search and YouTube, higher ad prices vs. last year, and sustained performance in Cloud, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Operating expense containment should protect margins even as capital expenditures rise, while conversations with ad agencies suggest that Q2’s momentum was sustained during Q3 across Search and YouTube, with growth in Health, Travel, Tech and Political, Truist added.

• The chart of the day

If the summer was about the ROI on AI, or really, the absence of it, how much patience does Wall Street have for tech’s fall earnings?

Judging by the surge in chip stocks, investors waiting for details about where all that infrastructure money is going and when new revenue will be coming will have to wait a while longer. An appreciating asset is its own defense.

As analysts press tech executives for clearer timelines around the supposed AI transformation, chip names continue to climb. Nvidia is once again threatening Apple as the market’s most valuable company. Semiconductor names are amassing gains, reversing a downfall from August. And on Wednesday, the rally fired up again after chip industry bellwether TSMC's (TSM) strong AI-fueled sales forecast.

That reflects the intense demand for AI processing and infrastructure and a disregard for short-term worries over ballooning capex. Chasing the dream is expensive.

And once again investors are wondering where the limit is — if it exists.

Third quarter reports are primed to test those boundaries with even more money at stake. The longer the capex hose stays open and the more vehemently executives fuse their identities with the AI wave, the harder it will be to turn back. Megacap tech companies are expected to dedicate $215 billion to AI capital expenditures this year, and according to Goldman Sachs, another $250 billion in 2025.

A slowdown in investment isn’t here yet. But we’ll be looking for clues on how long AI growth will last until company whims, preferences, and future spending start to reveal themselves on spreadsheets. It’s only a matter of time before the imagined productivity gains and “innovative AI use cases” come due.

The tight, symbiotic ecosystem of selling AI hardware suggests that as soon as Big Tech eases spending or pivots elsewhere, previously robust fundamentals might be destabilized.

The tech giants largely disappointed Wall Street last quarter. Only Meta came out with a clear victory. While reactions to earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) highlighted how heavy AI investment can become a liability, Zuckerberg showed that Wall Street doesn’t mind swelling capex, as long as every other part of the business is exceeding expectations. That’s a high bar to clear. And it will only get harder as the spending side of the ledger gets bigger without surefire revenue to offset it.

Seeing past risk is a virtue at the top of the corporate ladder. So is suppressing bubble chatter. If the upward trajectory of chip stocks is a bellwether then the tech giants will continue to double down on their mega disbursements. That’s what we would expect from tenacious leadership. Even if everyone else is anxious for answers. Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on X @hshaban.

2024-10-17T07:51:43+00:00,Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Most Promising Future Stock According to Analysts,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-googl-most-promising-075143957.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.

Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market.

A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells.

The economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September.

“It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.”

“But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels.

A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election.

While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around.

“Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows. AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth. Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value. To make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 216 Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s wide range of internet-related services and goods allows it to maintain its dominance in the digital market. One of the main factors contributing to Alphabet’s success has been the incorporation of AI throughout its product line. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are improving user engagement and advertising efficiency, from YouTube content recommendations to search algorithms. Despite competition from new chatbot technologies, Alphabet has maintained its market leadership in search thanks to this technological advantage, with reports showing an increase in market share. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s 2024 second-quarter results were outstanding, exceeding revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts. AI-driven advancements that improved ad performance and marketer return on ad spend (ROAS) drove the company’s core search business to show strong growth. Due to the increased demand for AI-related services, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) also demonstrated accelerated growth, surpassing the expansion of the entire cloud segment. With a substantial revenue of $328.28 billion over the past 12 months, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has demonstrated an impressive 13.38% growth in revenue. The analyst’s assessment that search growth projections may have been underestimated is supported by this growth trajectory. Because it is expanding, the digital advertising market is a desirable area to invest in. Digital advertising spending is anticipated to rise by 12% annually in 2024 and maintain double-digit growth through at least 2026. Consequently, Google’s ad revenue increased from $42.6 billion in 2023 to $48.5 billion in the second quarter. Almost 60% of Alphabet’s $84.7 billion in Q2 sales came from this. Alphabet gets its ad revenue from sources other than Google. YouTube, the world’s second-largest website after Google, is also owned by the conglomerate. In Q2, YouTube’s ad sales brought in $8.7 billion for Alphabet, up from $7.7 billion the year before. The robust revenue and earnings growth due to AI integration to enhance advertising is one reason the company is rated as a buy with an average price target of $206.60, implying a 26.87% change from the last price of $162.84. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). According to the Insider Monkey database, Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder, with a position of $8.86 billion. Overall GOOGL ranks 7th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.

2024-10-17T00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet Is Cheaper Than the S&P 500 Right Now. It's Time for Investors to Load Up.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/17/alphabet-is-cheaper-than-the-sp-500-right-now-its/,"Alphabet's stock is a strong bargain in a market full of expensive stocks.

Alphabet (GOOG 1.50%) (GOOGL 1.57%), the parent company of Google, is getting absolutely no love from the public markets right now. In fact, from a valuation standpoint, it's actually cheaper than the broader market, measured by the S&P 500.

That's an odd statement, considering that Alphabet is one of the most dominant tech companies on the market today. There's a reason for some pessimism with the stock, but is it enough to price it at a discount compared to the S&P 500?

Alphabet's stock is slightly cheaper than the S&P 500

Alphabet's stock has been fairly cheap throughout 2024, although its current state is about the cheapest it has been.

On a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, Alphabet is cheaper than the S&P 500, regardless of whether you look at trailing earnings or forward earnings. The S&P 500 currently trades for 24.7 times trailing earnings and 23.8 times forward earnings.

Essentially, the market is saying that Alphabet deserves a lower premium than the average S&P 500 constituent, which is an incredible statement.

Granted, Alphabet hasn't put itself in the best place, either. The Department of Justice indicated that it could seek to break up the company after Alphabet was found guilty of monopolistic practices. This frightened many investors, as they don't know how Alphabet would be broken up if it was forced to split up. However, this is years away, as Alphabet will challenge every part of this in court. Furthermore, when other companies are split up or divest a portion, the split often unlocks value, making the sum of the parts greater than the whole.

Although the DOJ case is one to watch, I don't think it should factor into an investor's decision to buy the stock.

Another reason Alphabet is being doubted is that some are worried the new search engines powered by generative AI could knock Alphabet from its pedestal atop the internet search market. I think there is a very low probability of this happening, as Alphabet's incredible market share (about 90%) means that a large number of people would have to change their habits. Google already added a generative AI-powered summary to the top of its search result, so in some ways, it's already evolved its platform before others could even try to usurp it.

There are many pessimistic headlines surrounding Alphabet, which led to its stock becoming so cheap. However, what remains is a company that's still doing quite well and worth investing in now. Its cheap stock price allows both investors and the company itself to get a great deal on the stock.

Because Alphabet is on the DOJ's radar, any acquisitions it wants to make are highly scrutinized. So, instead of using its cash pile to buy up other complementary companies, it buys back stock.

Similar to how an investor's money can buy more shares of a company with a cheap stock price, a company's buybacks have the same effect. Last quarter, Alphabet bought back $15 billion worth of shares, which reduced the share count by 2.6% year over year.

Alphabet's share repurchases will have a strong effect over a long time period and further amplify its earnings per share (EPS) growth. Because they reduce the denominator of this metric, they increase the output of the equation. Along with strong revenue growth (14% year over year), improved efficiencies, and share buybacks, Alphabet's EPS increased from $1.44 to $1.89 year over year in the second quarter -- a 31% rise.

Since stock price movements are highly correlated to earnings growth over the long term, Alphabet is poised to stomp the market in the future if it can keep delivering EPS growth like that. With it already trading at a discount to the broader market, it's about as no-brainer a buy as you can get right now.",GOOGL,yes,eod,812
2024-10-16T21:31:10+00:00,"Justice Department will ‘very likely’ kill Google’s billion-dollar deal to be the default search engine on iPhones, Jefferies predicts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/justice-department-very-likely-kill-213110571.html,"Analysts at Jefferies say it’s “very likely” the U.S. Department of Justice will ban Google’s longtime search deal on iPhones, a decision Jefferies predicts could sink Apple’s stock by as much as 11%.

Google has been at the center of the biggest antitrust trial in decades, as the DOJ questions practices that have kept the search engine front and center on smartphones and web browsers. Google has paid billions to Apple and others annually to have a prominent spot on devices up until now, but Jefferies analysts on Wednesday predicted the DOJ would ban those deals in the future as it tries to break up any search monopoly. Jefferies estimates the $25 billion deal makes up 20% of Apple’s pretax profit, or about 6.3% of total revenue, representing an 8% to 11% hit on share prices.

These deals have taken place since 2002 when Google first paid Apple a cut of its search advertising revenue to make Google the default search platform. According to the Financial Times, that gave Google access to Apple’s user base, with more than half of all search queries in the U.S. today currently flowing through Apple devices.

During the trial, DOJ lawyers argued that Google’s practice of paying billions to secure its position on platforms like Apple blocks competitors and prevents innovation. Google has repeatedly countered that its dominance stems from consumer preference and users can easily switch to other search engines if they wish. However, DOJ prosecutors contend that the sheer scale of these payments reveals the lengths to which Google goes to maintain its monopoly.

Even if the DOJ does end these deals, the effects may take time to materialize. Jefferies estimates it could take three to eight years for a final outcome in court, with the possibility of long appeals. Jefferies also called its own estimates “pessimistic,” noting they are part of a model in which there is zero offset in revenue by Apple. If the case is indeed tied up for years, as Jefferies predicts, Apple has plenty of time to course-correct and make up for any potential lost revenue. Jefferies also added the impact could be contained to the U.S. only, depending on the reaction from Europe to any DOJ decision.

Representatives from Jefferies, Apple, and Google did not immediately reply to Fortune's request for comment.

In the meantime, Apple’s stock price has remained relatively resilient, bolstered by investor optimism about upcoming products like the iPhone 17 as well as new AI-powered technologies.

Still, should the DOJ block the Google-Apple deal, it will mark a significant shift for both companies and could force Apple to explore its own search engine or deeper AI integrations—a path that carries its own risks. For Google, the stakes are equally high, if not higher. This case could fundamentally disrupt the company’s ability to use financial agreements to dominate the search-engine market.

The outcome of the case would also trigger ripple effects across the broader tech landscape, potentially opening doors for competitors such as Microsoft. As regulators around the globe keep a close eye on this case, it’s clear that both Google and Apple stand at the crossroads of a legal decision that could reshape their futures.

2024-10-16T19:45:25+00:00,Nvidia is set to dominate another Big Tech earnings season,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-is-set-to-dominate-another-big-tech-earnings-season-194525244.html,"We’re rolling into what is expected to be another wild tech earnings season, and you can bet AI is going to be front and center. And if there’s one company that everyone is watching, it’s Nvidia (NVDA).

Shares of the chip giant are up more than 16% in the last month, and the stock is currently on pace to unseat Apple as the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization.

The jump comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the company’s upcoming Blackwell chip is “insane” during an interview with CNBC on Oct. 3. Since then, shares of Nvidia have climbed roughly 18%, topping out at $130. But reports that the Biden administration will establish a cap on the number of AI chips that can be shipped to certain countries put the rally on hold Tuesday before recovering some ground Wednesday.

Nvidia’s incredible stock performance and meteoric rise in data center sales over the last year have put the company in a difficult position for its upcoming earnings announcement, which it has yet to officially schedule.

In the company’s fiscal Q3 2024, overall revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion, while data center revenue rose a whopping 279% to $14.5 billion. And while Nvidia isn’t staring down a decline in revenue, its growth will likely slow versus the same period last year, which could spook investors.

Don’t believe me? Just take a look at what happened after the company announced its Q2 earnings back in August. While the company beat on revenue and earnings per share, with data center revenue increasing 154% year over year to $26.3 billion, Nvidia shares still fell more than 6% immediately following the announcement. It took more than a month for the company’s stock price to recover.

The AI trade hasn’t raised all ships, either. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 59% year to date, outpacing the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which rose 21%. Qualcomm (QCOM) climbed 19% and AMD (AMD) added just 6% to its stock price. Intel (INTC), meanwhile, fell a stunning 55%.

Broadcom benefits from its involvement in AI infrastructure, connecting servers and the like, while Qualcomm is seen as a potential beneficiary of on-device AI growth via AI smartphones and AI PCs. AMD is facing off against Nvidia and serves as an alternative on both price and availability.

Then there’s Intel, which is struggling amid its enormous turnaround effort that includes building out its third-party chip fabrication capabilities as well as trying to catch Nvidia and AMD in the AI processor space.

But Nvidia is still the hands-down star of the show this earnings season. Investors will be looking for signs of continued AI spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which make up a huge portion of AI sales, to get a sense of how well Nvidia chips are selling.",GOOGL,yes,eod,614
2024-10-16T19:23:31+00:00,Jim Cramer on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): ‘The Stock’s A Comeback Kid And I Am So Glad We Own Some For The Charitable Trust’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-alphabet-inc-googl-192331305.html,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.

On Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique ""Poltergeist 2 magic.""

Cramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.

He noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.

Cramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:

Cramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.

For this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Talking about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in light of his “own it, not trade it” philosophy, Cramer said: “Now I don't feel the same way, candidly, about Alphabet and in part, that's because the government has made it much harder to own it, with this antitrust lawsuit that's aimed for a breakup, something I'm very much opposed to. I'm also concerned about Alphabet's ability to keep putting up strong earnings. Company now has a less defensible position because it's become more of a media business and that's a very competitive space… So, the stock’s a comeback kid and I am so glad we own some for the Charitable Trust.” Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) serves as the holding company formed from Google's restructuring in 2015, with Google itself primarily recognized as a leading search engine. As a dominant player in the digital advertising sector, the company benefits significantly from its successful Google Search platform, which contributed over half of the company's $84.7 billion in revenue during the second quarter. Google Cloud also reported great performance, achieving a 29% increase in year-over-year revenue growth in the same quarter. However, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is facing significant legal challenges. The U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company in 2020, accusing it of engaging in monopolistic practices, including paying $26.3 billion in 2021 to companies to secure Google as the default search engine. Recently, there have been indications from the Justice Department suggesting a breakup of Google to address its perceived monopoly in search. The Justice Department's proposed remedies could drastically alter how users will access information online, potentially reducing Google's revenues and allowing competitors to gain a foothold in the market. Additionally, these measures aim to prevent Google from extending its dominance into the growing field of artificial intelligence. There is also speculation that the Justice Department might seek to terminate Google's payments that facilitate its default status on new devices. Overall GOOGL ranks 4th on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Targeting Google's partnerships with smartphone manufacturers including Apple, the lawsuit is likely to have major financial reprecussions should the case result in changes in revenue-sharing rules. According to Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, the legal procedure could potentially take up to three to eight years to clear out, with Apple losing one-third of its U.S. Google income. Lee highlighted that, while the potential income loss remains alarming, and in the near-term sales of the iPhone 16 and the introduction of Apple Intelligence have become critical. With around half of Apple's yearly profits coming from the iPhone, it is still the biggest revenue source for the business. Despite the antitrust concerns, Apple's core products are likely to be at the top of the priority list for investors at this point.

Amazon (AMZN) is joining its artificial intelligence competitors in the race for nuclear energy.

The tech giant has signed three agreements “to support the development of nuclear energy projects,” it said Wednesday. The agreements include building “several” small modular reactors (SMRs). These “advanced” nuclear reactors have “a smaller physical footprint, allowing them to be built closer to the grid,” Amazon said. And compared with traditional reactors, SMRs can be put online faster because construction takes less time.

“Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040,” Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, said in a statement.

Garman said the investment in nuclear energy is “an important area of investment for Amazon,” because it is “both carbon-free and able to scale.”

Amazon’s agreement with Washington-based Energy Northwest will produce four advanced SMRs that will be built, owned, and operated by the utilities consortium. The tech giant is also investing in SMR reactors and fuel developer X-energy, it said. X-energy’s design for advanced nuclear reactors will be used for Amazon’s project with Energy Northwest.

Under Amazon’s agreement with Virginia-based Dominion Energy (D), the companies will develop an SMR near the utility company’s North Anna Nuclear Generating Station.

While the AI boom has boosted revenues for major tech companies, the technology’s massive demand for energy is hindering climate change efforts.

One query on ChatGPT needs almost 10 times as much electricity as a Google (GOOGL) search, according to a study by Goldman Sachs (GS). In April, Ami Badani, chief marketing officer of British chip designer Arm (ARM), said data centers powering AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT account for 2% of global electricity consumption. That demand, Badani said, could eventually slow down AI progress.

In July, Google said its carbon emissions have risen by 48% since 2019, mostly due to energy consumption by data centers and supply chain emissions. The company’s carbon emissions were up 13% year over year in 2023, according to its 2024 Environmental Report.

In the report, Google said it was “no longer maintaining operational carbon neutrality” and would turn to other “carbon solutions and partnerships” to reach its 2021 goal of reaching net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030.

In 2020, Microsoft (MSFT) set a similar goal to be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade. But in May, the company said its carbon emissions were almost 31% higher than in 2020, according to its 2024 Environmental Sustainability Report. That jump was mostly due to building data centers for AI, Microsoft said, as well as due to AI hardware such as semiconductors and servers.

“Our challenges are in part unique to our position as a leading cloud supplier that is expanding its datacenters,” Microsoft said in a statement. “But, even more, we reflect the challenges the world must overcome to develop and use greener concrete, steel, fuels, and chips.”

Data centers, which are in demand as companies continue developing larger, more powerful models, could consume up to 9% of electricity in the U.S. by 2030 — more than double what is being used now, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

Tech giants are taking notice of their growing carbon footprints.

In July, the Wall Street Journal (NWS) reported that a third of the U.S.’s nuclear power plants were discussing deals with tech companies to supply electricity for data centers.

Among them was Amazon, which was reportedly closing in on a deal to use electricity from Constellation Energy (CEG) — the owner of most of the country’s power plants.

In Amazon’s announcement Wednesday, it said it had made an agreement with Talen Energy “to co-locate a data center facility next to” the company’s Pennsylvania-based nuclear facility.

Earlier this week, Google announced it had signed “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy” from SMRs developed by California-based Kairos Power.

Google said it expects to bring Kairos Power’s first SMR online by the end of the decade. Other reactors will be deployed through 2035. Through the deal, 500 megawatts (MW) of 24/7 carbon-free power will be available to U.S. electricity grids.

In September, Microsoft and Constellation announced a 20-year power purchase agreement that would restart the Unit 1 reactor on Three Mile Island — close to the site of one of the worst nuclear power plant accidents ever in the U.S. Through the deal, which will launch the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC), Microsoft will purchase energy from the Unit 1 reactor as part of its sustainability goal.

The CCEC, which is expected to come online by 2028, will add more than 800 MW of carbon-free electricity to the power grid, a study by the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council found.

Amazon and other tech giants have announced plans to invest in nuclear power to help meet rising demands for clean energy. (Paul Kuroda / For The Times)

Amazon on Wednesday announced plans to invest in nuclear power production to fuel its data centers with clean energy, a key part of the e-commerce giant's push to expand AI-powered services.

""Nuclear energy is safe, reliable, and can help meet the energy needs of our customers for decades to come,"" said Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services' vice president of global data centers in a statement. The company has a goal to achieve net-zero carbon — where the amount of greenhouse gases produced equals the amount removed from the atmosphere — across its operations by 2040.

Amazon is the latest tech giant to turn to nuclear power as a source of clean energy as the demand for more power in data centers grows. Earlier this week, Google announced its partnership with California-based Kairos Power, in which Google plans to buy power produced from small nuclear reactors built by Kairos. The first reactor is scheduled to be running by 2030.

And last month Microsoft announced an agreement with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, in which the facility would be brought back online to produce energy for Microsoft.

Amazon is partnering with Dominion Energy Virginia, Energy Northwest and Talen Energy to explore new efforts to advance nuclear energy, including the development of smaller and faster nuclear reactors. The company is also investing in Maryland-based X-Energy Reactor Company, which announced on Wednesday it's raised $500 million in financing.

Robert Blue, chair, president and chief executive of Dominion Energy, called the partnership an ""important step forward"" that would fuel the development of ""carbon-free power generation in Virginia,"" according to a news release from the company.

The partnerships come as tech companies face more demands for electricity because of the race to build more AI services that can generate text, images and other content. Tech giants, which already invest in solar and wind technologies, are searching for new sources of clean energy amid growing pressure to limit the greenhouse gas emissions they produce as they expand their AI products. These gasses trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to rising temperatures.

A query on OpenAI's ChatGPT, on average, requires nearly 10 times as much electricity to process as a Google search, according to Goldman Sachs. Analysts for the firm estimate that the power needed to run data centers, where large-scale computing operations are done to support a variety of tech services, will grow 160% by 2030.

Total electricity consumption of data centers could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026, more than doubling the usage in 2022, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency.

Amazon's announcement drew praise from lawmakers and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm as the United States pursues a goal of being completely dependent on clean electricity by 2035.

In July, Amazon said it hit its goal of powering its global operations, including its data centers, with 100% renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of its target of 2030.

Investors are betting on a resurgence in demand for nuclear energy, and their optimism is not without reason as tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) are placing multibillion-dollar bets on the sector.

What's going on with nuclear power?

Last month, Microsoft ignited the rally in nuclear stocks when it signed a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG) under which the latter will reopen Unit 1 of its Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. Microsoft needs extra power to run the servers at its Azure business unit, and thinks nuclear might be the best way to produce that power in a carbon-free way.

Momentum in the sector picked up this week with announcements from first Alphabet and then Amazon that they, too, are looking to nuclear energy to power their data centers.

Alphabet's Google business is partnering with privately held Kairos Power to open a series of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Totaling only 500 megawatts (MW) in power production capacity, the Google news is only half as big as Microsoft's. (Full-scale nuclear power plants generally generate power in the gigawatt range). But that's not why the Google news is significant. It's backing an entirely new kind of nuclear power plants -- SMRs, which are expected to be both cheaper and faster to build than traditional plants.

In theory, that could drive demand for nuclear energy -- and for uranium to fuel it -- faster than simply building more gigawatt-scale power plants would do. It's this prospect that lies behind the strong interest in uranium producer stocks Wednesday.

Enthusiasm only grew greater Wednesday morning when Amazon announced plans to partner with Energy Northwest, Dominion Energy (NYSE: D), and privately held X-energy to build four SMRs in the state of Washington and at least one in Virginia. Combined, these projects promise to bring at least 620 megawatts of nuclear power online -- and potentially more than 1 gigawatt, equivalent to a full-scale nuclear power plant.

Should you buy uranium stocks now?

But should you be buying uranium stocks in the middle of a uranium stock-buying frenzy? While I'm bullish on the prospects for the nuclear power industry in general and am finding validation for that bullishness in all this recent news, I still think the answer to this question is ... maybe, but tread carefully and watch the valuations.

With a market cap of less than $2 billion even after this latest share price surge, Denison Mines is arguably the cheapest of these three stocks, trading at ""only"" 47 times trailing earnings. Denison also has no debt on its balance sheet, and $93 million in cash -- which is good news, because it will need it. It's currently burning cash at the rate of $28 million a year, and isn't expected to turn free cash flow positive until 2028, according to the analysts who follow it. Cameco is a horse of a different color. Valued at more than $24 billion currently, it is easily the most valuable stock in this sector. On the other hand, it trades at a staggering 129 times trailing earnings. Cameco is both profitable and free cash flow positive, and analysts expect its profits to roughly triple over the next five years. Still, with a valuation that's 27.5 times its forecast earnings in 2028, it's hard to call the stock cheap. And Energy Fuels? With a $1.3 billion market cap, Energy Fuels is only a little less expensive than Denison. Analysts hope Energy Fuels turns profitable next year, and begins generating free cash flow in 2027. It's unprofitable today, however, and in its 25-year history, it hasn't ever generated positive free cash flow. While Energy Fuels stock looks speculative to me, it possesses cash reserves that should be sufficient to last until its free cash flow turns positive. In a momentum-driven market where none of these stocks looks cheap by the traditional valuation metrics of price to earnings, or price to free cash flow, tiny Energy Fuels might turn out to be the best performer of all.

The Seattle-based company has signed agreements to develop the new breed of reactors — dubbed small modular reactors, or SMRs — in both Washington and Virginia, investing in in X-Energy, a privately-held advanced nuclear reactor developer.

The financing will help pay for the development of more than 5 gigawatts of new power projects coming online across the US by 2039, X-Energy said in a statement Wednesday.

“It’s going to allow us to build smaller, self-contained power generation near data centers, near where we want in a completely safe and scalable way,” Matt Garman, chief executive officer of Amazon Web Services, said during remarks at the company’s offices in Arlington, Virginia.

Amazon’s announcement comes as technology companies are searching for new energy supplies to power massive data centers needed to run artificial intelligence systems. Alphabet Inc.’s Google announced Monday it was backing the nuclear power and signed an agreement with Kairos Power to construct a series of SMRs that use molten-salt cooling technology.

Data center expansion and other factors are expected to drive electricity demand up 15% to 20% over the next decade, according to the US Energy Department. Data centers could consume as much as 9% of the nation’s electricity generation annually by 2030, up from 4% in 2023, according to a report in May by the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute.

Amazon has also signed agreements with Washington State-based utility Energy Northwest and Virginia’s Dominion Energy, Inc. to develop SMR projects. Amazon said the reactors — which will be constructed, owned and operated by Energy Northwest — were expected to generate roughly 320 megawatts, with the option to expand to 960 megawatts total.

In Virginia, Amazon said it had signed an agreement with Dominion to explore the development of an SMR project at the utility’s existing North Anna nuclear power station that could bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the region.

Unlike traditional nuclear reactors, which are enormous facilities that take years to build, SMRs can be built at factories, delivered by truck or train, and then assembled on-site, saving time and money. Utilities can install just one or bundle several together, expanding the potential market by including countries that don’t need a big conventional nuclear plant.

Still, the technology hasn’t yet been deployed at scale, commercially. And SMR’s have their critics, including those who say the economics of nuclear power is flawed no matter what the size of the reactors. NuScale Power Corp. announced in November it was canceling plans to build a series of SMRs in Utah amid surging costs. Meanwhile, surging demand for power is prompting utilities to build more natural gas-fired plants, undermining lofty environmental goals for both the industry and tech firms. “Artificial intelligence may be new, but claims that the next revolutionary nuclear technology will solve our energy problems have been around since we first split the atom,” Johanna Neumann, an official with Environment America, said in a statement. “It’s time for Big Tech to recommit to solutions that work and pose less risk to our environment and health, including making data centers as energy efficient as possible and committing them to be powered by new renewable energy sources.”

(GOOG) the Best Internet Content Stock to Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-goog-best-internet-133605000.html,"We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks among the best internet content stocks.

According to Grand View Research, The global digital content creation market value stood at $25.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% from 2023 to 2030. In 2023, North America dominated the digital content market. The primary drivers are the increasing use of social media and the digital change occurring across different industries. According to a study by Kepios, 62.3% of individuals in the entire globe use social media. As of April 2024, the average daily usage is 2 hours and 23 minutes per this study. Kepios analysis reveals that the number of people using social media grew meaningfully during the first three months of 2024, and annual growth rates are still significantly more than 5%.

Content creation is also being transformed by artificial intelligence. According to Custom Market Insights, the global market for AI-powered content creation was valued at $2.3 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% to reach USD 7.9 billion by 2033. Moreover, AI programs like GPT-4 are being used to generate graphics, music, and text. Gartner projects that 30% of all digital content will be artificial intelligence generated by 2025. This facilitates hyperpersonalization, which allows material to be personalized to specific consumers while also streamlining the content creation process.

Secondly, the popularity of short-form video material is skyrocketing, emerging as a major trend in the content production industry. Platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok have paved the way for this movement. In 2024, 85% of marketers anticipate short-form videos to be the most successful type of social media content, according to a HubSpot survey. The snackable aspect of this format makes it ideal for grabbing the attention spans of increasingly transient internet consumers.

Thirdly, digital content is projected to become more interactive in the future. Advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are opening up greater opportunities for immersive experiences. The AR and VR market is expected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030, according to a PwC report.

If we take a broader view, according to the PWC’s Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2024-2028, there are a number of significant growth prospects in the industry, which is expected to reach US$3.4 trillion by 2028. Notwithstanding persistent upheavals and the necessity of reinventing company models, the industry presents substantial income opportunities. Growth is anticipated to be driven by advertising, with spending forecast to reach US $1 trillion by 2026 because of connected TV and internet advertisements. Due to market saturation, streaming services are being forced to investigate ad-supported business models and creative content. Revenues from gaming are predicted to surpass $300 billion by 2028, particularly in Asia Pacific. The industry is still thriving. Companies navigating shifting market dynamics will find more opportunities in high-growth regions and market categories.

2024-10-16T13:25:47+00:00,Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best High Growth NASDAQ Stock That is Profitable in 2024?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-googl-best-high-132547769.html,"We recently compiled a list of 10 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable in 2024. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable.

Will the Bull Market Continue as We Enter the Earnings Season?

Malcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, joined CNBC to talk about where the market could go and his sentiment regarding the AI and overall tech sector. While many analysts believe that it will be the small caps that will lead the growth with interest rates easing and the economy slowing down. We recently covered the 8 Most Undervalued Penny Stocks To Buy According To Analysts, where we talked about how Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors likes the small cap in the current market environment. Here’s a piece from the article:

“To talk about what the stock market looks like today and in the near future. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors joined CNBC in a recent interview. He has been one of the strong proponents and supporters of small-cap stocks. Lee says that we are in a volatile environment currently, due to a few reasons, one being the elections in less than 30 days, the second being the Middle Eastern crisis which is scaring investors, and lastly the port strike that has the potential to cripple the economy. However, he still expressed his optimism that the year-end has a lot of tailwinds and investors shouldn’t be afraid to buy the dip. Moreover, Lee also highlighted that these current events are all short-term headwinds in a buying cycle and are expected to die down quickly.

Ethridge thinks otherwise, he believes that mega-cap stocks will continue to lead market growth, although not at the same pace as in recent years but still at a steady pace. He attributes this to the ongoing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on various sectors, including real estate and manufacturing, which are becoming increasingly vital due to rising demands on infrastructure.

Moreover, while explaining why the mega caps will lead the growth, Ethridge pointed out that for the big tech stocks, Fed rate cuts were not necessary as they had significant cash on their balance sheets to reinvest into newer AI ventures. We have already seen Magnificent Seven invest heavily in AI despite the high rate of borrowing thereby leading the bull market in difficult times. The rate cuts have now made it easy for other companies that didn’t have enough cash to borrow and invest in technology. However, he also pointed out that the pace of rate cuts might slow down moving forward, thereby making it hard for small caps to keep up the technology investment race. Ethridge suggests that investors may need to adjust their expectations regarding future Federal Reserve rate cuts. Moreover, we are also entering earnings season, will the earnings derail the momentum or continue to boost the market? Drew Pettit, Citi Research Director of US Equity Strategy joined CNBC in another interview. He thinks that we are in for a decent quarter, although we are in an expensive market. While talking about how various sectors will perform, Pettit mentioned that software has the highest bar within tech, meaning its growth expectations are high, yet many software companies are not monetizing effectively. This creates volatility in stock performance. As earnings reports come in, Pettit suggests investors should focus on consumer behavior and credit conditions, particularly in the banking sector, which is expected to perform well this quarter. He also encouraged investors to look beyond the recent quarter earnings into 2025 and 2026, while choosing companies to invest in. To curate the list of 10 high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024 we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Yahoo Finance as our sources. Using the stock screener, we got an initial list of major NASDAQ stocks sorted by their market capitalization. Next, we sourced the 5-year net income growth and revenue growth rates for these stocks from Seeking Alpha and the GAAP trailing twelve-month net income from Yahoo Finance. We only selected stocks that had 5-year net income and revenue growth of more than 15%. Lastly, we ranked the stocks by the number of hedge fund holders in Q2 2024 from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks 3rd on our list of high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024. It is one of the Magnificent Seven technology companies known for its subsidiary Google. The company has significant development in artificial intelligence, Google Cloud, and is known for its other products as well including YouTube, Gmail, and Android Operating systems among others. Investors are on the lookout for its autonomous driving venture, Waymo. While Tesla gets the majority coverage when it comes to self-driving car ambition, however, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with its Waymo venture has quietly made significant progress. Last week the company announced a significant robotaxi deal with Hyundai, a South Korean automaker. With this multi-year strategic partnership, Hyundai will use the autonomous driving technology of Waymo in 5 of its SUVs for the next 5 years. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) plans to launch its robotaxis for test drives by the end of 2025 and is expected to deploy a large fleet on public roads in the following years. It won’t be wrong to say that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is leading the robotaxi race as a fleet of around 700 self-driving cars are already operating in major states of the United States including Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The company is testing its services in Texas as well. If we talk about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as a whole, the company has been generating significant revenues on the back of its search and cloud segments. The revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was up 14% year-over-year to reach $85 billion. Moreover, the company has generated more than $87 Billion in net income on a trailing twelve-month basis. Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.” Overall GOOGL ranks 3rd on our list of the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a promising AI stock that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

2024-10-16T13:19:05+00:00,Jim Cramer Says Alphabet (GOOG) Google Search is ‘Most Incredible’ Bargain in the World,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-alphabet-goog-131905624.html,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. Since Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 3th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Jim Cramer during his October 14 program on CNBC looked excited as he celebrated the rebound of major tech stocks, saying these companies are showing their “staying power” despite the odds.

Cramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding.

“This rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There’s a lot of money going around, and we know there’s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won’t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.”

For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.

Talking about the US government’s efforts to break up Google, Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC said:

Despite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine’s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google’s market share.

Cloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. Oakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-based communication services company’s stock price fell after a U.S. District Court ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining a monopoly in general search engine services via exclusive distribution agreements. We think this case is unlikely to hurt Alphabet’s valuation over the long term as regulations previously en[1]acted in the European Union to address similar issues did not materially erode the company’s market share. We continue to believe that Alphabet is an attractive investment.” Overall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 3th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-10-16T12:49:23+00:00,"Amazon, Google make dueling nuclear investments to power data centers with clean energy",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-google-dueling-nuclear-investments-124923523.html,"Amazon (AMZN) on Wednesday said that it was investing in small nuclear reactors, coming just two days after a similar announcement by Google (GOOG), as both tech giants seek new sources of carbon-free electricity to meet surging demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

The plans come as the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said last month it plans to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft can buy the power to supply its data centers. All three companies have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions. Now they say they need to go further in the search for clean electricity to meet both demand and their own commitments to cut emissions.

Nuclear energy is a climate solution in that its reactors don’t emit the planet-warming greenhouse gases that come from power plants that burn fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. The demand for power is surging globally as buildings and vehicles electrify. People used more electricity than ever last year, placing strain on electric grids around the world. Much of the demand also comes from data centers and artificial intelligence.

The International Energy Agency forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt hours in 2026, more than doubling from 2022. Estimates suggest one terawatt hour can power 70,000 homes for a year.

“AI is driving a significant increase in the amount of data centers and power that are required on the grid,” Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services’ vice president of global data centers, told The Associated Press, adding: “We view advanced new nuclear capacity as really key and essential.""

The United States is pursuing small modular reactors, a type of nuclear reactor that can generate up to roughly one-third the amount of power of a traditional reactor. Developers say small reactors will be built faster and at a lower cost than large power reactors, scaling to fit needs of a particular location. They aim to start spinning up electricity in the early 2030s, if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gives permission to build and operate their designs and the technology succeeds.

If new, clean power isn’t added as data centers are developed, the U.S. runs the risk of “browning the grid,” or including more power that isn't made from clean sources, said Kathryn Huff, a former U.S. assistant secretary for nuclear energy who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

The reactors are currently under development, with none currently providing power to the electric grid in the U.S. Big investors can help change that, and these announcements could be the “inflection point” that makes scaling up this technology truly possible, Huff said. Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, echoed that, saying the industry needs customers who value the reliability and carbon-free attributes of nuclear and are willing to pay a premium for it at first, until a number of the next-generation reactors are deployed and the cost comes down. On Monday, Google said it was signing a contract to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors that Kairos Power, a nuclear technology company, plans to develop. The news highlights “the technologies that we’re going to need to achieve round the clock clean energy, not only for Google but for the world,” Michael Terrell, Google's senior director of energy and climate, told the AP. With Kairos, Google said it expects to bring the first small modular reactor online by 2030, with more to come through 2035. The deal is projected to bring 500 megawatts of power to the grid. For context, Google consumed more than 24 terawatt hours of electricity last year, according to the company's annual environmental report. One terawatt is equal to 1,000,000 megawatts. Meanwhile, Amazon's announcements Wednesday included working with utility Dominion Energy to explore putting a small modular reactor near its existing North Anna nuclear power station in Virginia. It's investing in reactor developer X-energy for its early development work, and collaborating with regional utility Energy Northwest in central Washington to put four of the X-energy reactors there. Combined, the three announcements could account for more than 5,000 megawatts of power by the late 2030s with the possibility of more. All of that is still likely only a small fraction of the company’s total energy consumption, a figure that Amazon does not report publicly. New reactor designs pair well with industrial applications because they can be built on a small footprint and generate reliable power, with some able to provide high-temperature heat too, at the site, said Doug True, chief nuclear officer at the industry trade association, Nuclear Energy Institute. “It seems like a really good fit to support those facilities, and for a lot of different applications depending upon the amount of power that’s needed by the customer,” he said. Both Amazon and Google have committed to using renewable energy to address climate change. By 2030, Google has pledged to meet net-zero emissions, and run carbon-free energy every hour of every day on every grid where it operates. It says it has already matched 100% of its global electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases on an annual basis. However, the company has fallen short on decreasing its emissions. Amazon has said it would match all of its global electricity consumption with 100% renewable energy by 2030, and recently announced it met that goal early in 2023. Though the company has matched its consumption as far as purchases of an equivalent amount of renewable energy, that does not necessarily mean it is using that to power its operations. Amazon saw its electricity emissions drop 11%, but direct emissions — known as Scope 1 — increased 7%, according to its 2023 sustainability report. The company is also targeting net zero-carbon by 2040.

Not Bill Ackman. His Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund owns stakes in only nine companies. However, this approach has worked out pretty well for Ackman through the years: His net worth totals $9.1 billion.

Over 20% of Ackman's portfolio is invested in one artificial intelligence (AI) stock. And Wall Street thinks the stock will soar over 20% within the next 12 months.

What is Ackman's favorite AI stock these days? It's Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). His Pershing Square hedge fund owns class A and class C shares of the tech giant worth roughly $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2024.

Ackman initiated a position in Alphabet in the first quarter of 2023. OpenAI had launched ChatGPT to rousing success only a few months earlier. Alphabet's subsequent introduction of its generative AI app Bard didn't go very well.

With Alphabet's share price sinking on the bumbling Bard launch, Ackman began aggressively buying the stock. He noted in a CNBC interview later in 2023 that Alphabet was integrating AI throughout its products and designing its own AI chips. The billionaire investor also thought the company had a competitive advantage with its access to data to use in training AI models.

Sure, Ackman reduced Pershing Square's stake in Alphabet in the second quarter of 2024 somewhat. It's still the hedge fund's largest position, though, with the class A and class C shares combined. Alphabet has also been a huge winner for Ackman.

Wall Street believes Alphabet can continue its winning ways. The average 12-month price target for the stock is $200.67. That reflects an upside potential of 21.6%. The most pessimistic analyst surveyed by LSEG thinks that Alphabet's shares will rise over the next 12 months.

Thirteen of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in October rate Alphabet as a ""strong buy."" Another 256 recommend the stock as a ""buy."" The remaining five analysts view Alphabet as a ""hold."" None think investors should sell the stock.

BMO Capital's recent reiteration of an ""outperform"" rating (the equivalent of a ""buy"" recommendation) for Alphabet highlights why many on Wall Street like the stock. The firm wrote to investors that AI, especially generative AI, should provide a significant growth opportunity for the company's Google Cloud unit.

In the second quarter of 2024, Google Cloud revenue soared 29% to $10.3 billion. Its operating income nearly tripled year over year to $1.17 billion. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in the Q2 earnings call that his company's generative AI solutions ""have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers.""

Is Wall Street right about Alphabet? Alphabet faces some challenges. The company has wrangled with regulators multiple times through the years. It's now doing so again with a federal judge ruling that Google unfairly stifled competition in the search engine business. Google also is embroiled in another antitrust lawsuit alleging illegal monopolization of the digital advertising industry. Some concerns remain that generative AI could eventually be a Google killer. Research firm eMarketer predicts Google's search ad market share in the U.S. will fall below 50% for the first time in a decade due to increased competition from TikTok and AI start-ups such as Perplexity. Despite these issues, I won't be surprised if Wall Street is right that Alphabet stock can rise another 20% or more over the next 12 months. I wouldn't write off Alphabet's long-term prospects, either. As Ackman told CNBC last year, ""[Alphabet] will be a dominant player in AI for the very, very long term.""

• Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure
• Mexico Seeks to Halve Permitting Time to Attract More Factories
• What It Takes to Make City Solutions Go Viral

“It’s going to have a massive effect, positive effect,” Trump told Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait on Tuesday in an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago.

Throughout the hour-long exchange, Trump repeatedly dismissed predictions by economists that his policies would have a net-negative impact on the economy and pass costs onto US consumers.

The former president shrugged off the possibility that his proposed tariffs might disrupt supply chains or squeeze small businesses, saying companies would rapidly return manufacturing to the US to avoid the levies. He argued that the impact of his plans to deport millions of undocumented migrants would be offset by legal migration. And, he said, his leadership would inspire loyalty rather than anger from allies.

“We’re all about growth,” Trump said. “We’re going to bring companies back to our country.”

The Republican nominee’s claims were warmly received by attendees at the event, who cheered his argument that dramatically increasing tariffs on foreign goods would protect “the companies that we have here and the new companies that will move in.”

The room was packed with about 600 people and a sizable contingent of Trump staffers. Executives in the room included Ashley Duchossois, chair of Duchossois Capital Management, the Chicago-based dynasty that’s known for its ties to the Churchill Downs racetrack and traditionally votes Republican. Carole Brown, Chicago’s former chief financial officer under then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel, attended as a member of the club.

Pat Greco, wearing a red hat with Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan and a dark suit, stood out in the ballroom. The 32-year-old corporate attorney said it was his first Trump event, though he had met the former president once before.

“I was shocked he was coming, to be honest,” Greco said before Trump started speaking.

Trump is banking on a similar reception from voters, who are already casting their ballots in what polls forecast to be a razor-thin contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris three weeks before Election Day.

Trump indicated he would pursue many of the norm-smashing tactics of his first term were he returned to the Oval Office, including seeking greater influence at the Federal Reserve. While the former president sidestepped a question about whether he would seek to remove Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, he said it was fair game for a president to tell the central bank’s chief how he thinks interest rates should change. “If you’re a very good president with good sense, you should be able to at least talk to him,” Trump said, adding that he did not believe a president should be able to mandate change. Trump also mocked the job of running the Fed. “It’s the greatest job in government,” Trump said. “You show up to the office once a month and you say, ‘let’s say flip a coin’ and everybody talks about you like you’re a God.” Trump also dismissed concerns over the federal deficit, long a focus of Republican presidential campaigns, arguing without evidence that the totality of his economic platform would outpace the cost to taxpayers. The former president has vowed to carry out an aggressive campaign of deregulation, renew expiring tax cuts, lower the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21%, and offer fresh tax reductions and benefits to bolster domestic manufacturing — policies cheered by prominent Wall Street and corporate leaders. But the proposals would cost trillions of dollars and threaten to worsen a US federal deficit that’s already historically large. Some investors are betting Trump’s policies will leave the US saddled with more debt and higher inflation and interest rates. America’s annual deficit is already close to $2 trillion. Trump has sought to offset some of those costs by threatening across-the-board tariffs, which he aims to impose on both US allies and adversaries, including a 60% levy on imports from China and 10% duties on the rest of the world. Trump said the tariffs would help “tremendously” in preventing China and other countries from flooding the US with products that threatened key industries, like the auto sector. “China thinks we’re a stupid country. A very stupid country. They can’t believe that somebody finally got wise to them,” he said. But economists say tariffs are unlikely to create the revenue he needs. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates the tariffs could raise over $200 billion a year. The US took in an estimated $4.9 trillion in revenue in fiscal 2024. Trump dismissed those projections, saying doubters were simply “wrong” about the impact of tariffs. “We will grow,” he said. “The only way you can do it is through the threat of tariffs.” Occasionally testy exchanges included many of the unproven assertions or falsehoods that have peppered Trump’s campaign events, from inaccurate claims about the number of undocumented migrants who have been convicted of murder to claiming fraud was to blame for his defeat in the 2020 election to President Joe Biden. On migration, Trump acknowledged the concerns of business owners worried his proposed immigration raids could shrink the labor supply, but indicated he would replace those migrants with people coming into the country legally. “I want a lot of people to come into our country but I want them to come in legally,” Trump said. During his first term, Trump proposed immigration policies that would have reduced the number of immigrants entering the country and prioritized high-skill workers, which economists warned could impact industries currently reliant on migrant labor. The Republican nominee and allies have said he would accept the 2024 election results if it is a fair process, raising concern of a repeat of Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol in a bid to block the certification of Biden’s victory. Trump sidestepped a question about whether he would commit to respecting a peaceful transfer of power, defending his actions during the attempted insurrection and noting that he left the White House at the end of his term. “I left the morning that I was supposed to leave, I went to Florida, and you had a very peaceful transfer,” Trump said. Trump suggested without evidence that individuals beyond his supporters had been responsible for the violence at the Capitol, saying that “a lot of strange things happened,” and generally downplayed the violence. More than 1,400 people have been charged in connection to the incident, according to the Justice Department. Trump also said that Ashli Babbitt, a supporter who was shot as she attempted to enter a barricaded door at the Capitol, was the only person who died on Jan. 6. A bipartisan Senate report found that at least seven people died in connection with the riot. Trump used the forum to weigh in on some of the biggest stories in business, reiterating his pledge to block the sale of US Steel Corp. to Nippon Steel Corp., if the $14.1 billion transaction was concluded by the time he entered office. “I think it sets a horrible tone,” he said of the possible sale, saying that steel was a critical national security interest. “There are certain companies you have to have,” Trump said. Both Biden and Harris have said they oppose the deal, an election flash point, particularly in swing-state Pennsylvania, where both the American company and the United Steelworkers union — which also opposes the deal — are based. Separately, Trump wouldn’t commit when asked whether the Justice Department should seek the forced breakup of Google, saying that while he believed something should be done to make the search engine “more fair” it may not require Alphabet Inc. to spin off its parts. “They do treat me very badly,” Trump said. The DOJ is weighing whether to break up Google as a remedy after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market. In August, Trump called for his supporters to stop using the Google search engine, referring to claims from billionaire backer Elon Musk and others that it was interfering with efforts to find information about the former president. Trump declined to say if he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving office in 2021, responding to a question about claims laid out in a new book by journalist Bob Woodward. “Well, I don’t comment on that, but I will tell you that if I did, it’s a smart thing,” Trump said. “If I’m friendly with people, if I have a relationship with people, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. “ Woodward’s book cites an unnamed aide to the former president indicating that he spoke to Putin as many as seven times since leaving office. The Trump campaign has called Woodward’s claim “made-up stories.” Trump defended their relationship, saying their positive ties were a boon to the US and that he had cultivated connections with the Russian leader even though he had sanctioned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Europe. Trump and Harris have been ramping up their economic messaging, in particular in the battleground states likely to determine November’s election. Trump, asked what states he would be watching on election night, said Pennsylvania or Michigan — two of the three that comprise the Democratic Blue Wall crucial to Harris’ prospects — could ultimately prove decisive. “Based on the votes that are coming in so far, we’re doing very well,” Trump said, pointing to early voting data. --With assistance from Isis Almeida, Elizabeth Campbell, Kim Chipman, Hadriana Lowenkron, Stephanie Lai and María Paula Mijares Torres.

2024-10-15T19:08:24+00:00,Tesla Fails To Justify The Robotaxi Hype With Concrete Figures,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-fails-justify-robotaxi-hype-190824530.html,"Last week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi, the star of its next chapter. The Cybercab was revealed at the massive Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California, known as Hollywood. Like the Cybertruck, Tesla’s robotaxi has a futuristic design, but the “We, Robot” event failed to impress. After the event, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s net worth went down by $15 billion as he holds about 13% of the company’s shares, but he remains the world’s richest person.

More Information About The Cybercab

With production scheduled for some time before 2027, Musk also revealed that the Cybercab, which would compete with rivals including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Waymo, would cost less than $30,000, which is about the same price as its cheaper Model 3 and Model Y. Moreover, the Cybercab has no plug as it would use inductive charging, one for which Tesla does not currently have infrastructure for, raising many concerns about the cost of making this driverless dream actually happen.

After a decade of failing to meet his own deadlines, Musk’s prediction that production of the Cybercab would begin some time ""before 2027” is seen as questionable. Paul Miller from Research Forrester believes it will be extremely difficult for Tesla to offer a new vehicle at that price within that timeframe, which means Tesla would be making a loss on every vehicle.

The glitzy showcase failed to shake off the feeling that Tesla is losing the race.

Thursday was supposed to be the unveiling of Tesla’s new chapter, providing a glimpse of its future built on Musk’s latest driverless dreams. But with Musk’s, history of falling short on promises and Tesla’s past of safety issues, there are many concerns around the Cybercab. Adding to the fact that Alphabet is already operating with Waymo, along with other Chinese firms, Tesla is still far from disrupting the landscape. Many have faltered with automated driving technology when it came to figuring out a profitable business model. For example, it took Google quite some time to scale Waymo. On Thursday, humanoid Optimus robots served drinks and the world got a glimpse of Tesla’s robotaxi fleet, “Cybercab” and “Robovan”, with disappointment in the air. While reasons varied, from not-so-thrilling joyrides in the new vehicles to not-so-self-functioning self-functioning robots and so-on, Tesla failed to impress as it goes up against not only Google and its Waymo, but General Motors (NYSE: GM) and its Cruise autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Zoox, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)’s self-driving subsidiary. All in all, the market was probably mostly disappointed because they the dazzling event failed not provide any concrete numbers.

2024-10-15T18:49:53+00:00,Startup that wants to be the eBay for AI data taps Google vets and a top IP lawyer for key roles,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/startup-wants-ebay-ai-data-184953898.html,"If data is the new oil, a London-based startup is vying to become the equivalent of the New York Mercantile Exchange—a marketplace where AI companies looking for data to train their AI models can strike deals with publishers and other businesses that have data to sell.

The startup, called Human Native AI, has recently hired a number of prominent former Google executives with experience in striking content licensing deals and partnership as well as top legal eagles experienced in intellectual property and copyright issues.

To date, companies building the large language models (LLMs) that have powered the generative AI revolution have mostly harvested data, for free, by scraping the public internet, often with little regard for copyright.

But there are signs this era is rapidly drawing to a close. In the U.S., a number of lawsuits against AI companies for allegedly violating copyright law when training AI models on material taken from the internet without permission are making their way through the courts. While it is possible judges will rule that such activity can be considered “fair use,” companies creating AI models would rather not risk being tied up in court for years.

In Europe, the new EU AI Act mandates that companies disclose if they trained AI models on copyrighted material, potentially opening companies up to legal action there too.

AI companies have already been striking deals with major publishers and news organizations to license data for both training and to make sure their models have access to up-to-date, accurate information. OpenAI signed a three-year licensing deal with publisher Axel Springer, which owns Business Insider, Politico, and a number of German news organizations, reportedly worth ""tens of millions of dollars."" It has also signed deals with the Financial Times, The Atlantic, and Time magazine. Google has similar deals with many publishers. Fortune has a licensing agreement with generative AI startup Perplexity.

Startups may have trouble securing business insurance if their data gathering practices potentially expose them to legal risk, providing another incentive for many of these companies to license the data they need.

Scraping data is also becoming more difficult from a technical standpoint as many businesses have begun using technical means to try to prevent bots from scraping their data. Some artists have also begun applying special digital masks to images they post online that can corrupt AI models trained from this data without permission.

In addition, the largest large language models (LLMs)—the type of AI that powers OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude—have already ingested the entire internet’s worth of publicly available data. Meanwhile, training effective smaller AI models, especially those designed for special purposes, such as helping lawyers draft specific types of contracts, scientists design new drugs, or engineers create blueprints, requires curated datasets of high-quality information pertaining to that task. Very little of this kind of specialized data is available on the public internet, so it can only be obtained through licensing arrangements.

That’s why James Smith, a veteran Google and Google DeepMind engineer and product manager, decided to cofound Human Native with Jack Galilee, a software engineer who worked on machine learning systems at medical technology company Grail. “We were wondering why there was not an easy way for companies to acquire the data they needed to train AI models,” Smith, now Human Native’s CEO, said. Even when AI companies wanted to source data ethically and legally, it was often difficult, he said, for them to find out who held what data, and then figure out who at that company to speak to in order to strike a licensing deal. The time currently required to negotiate such deals could also be an impediment for fast-moving AI model developers—with some taking the view that if they took the time to do the right thing, they risked falling behind rivals commercially, he said. Human Native intends to be a digital marketplace that will enable those who need data for AI systems to easily connect with those who have it and to strike a deal using relatively standardized legal contracts. In June, it raised a $3.6 million seed round led by London-based venture capital firms LocalGlobe and Mercuri to begin to make good on that vision. It also counts among its advisors entrepreneur, AI developer, and musician Ed Newton-Rex, who headed the audio team at genAI company Stability AI, but has since emerged as a prominent critic of AI companies' disregard for copyright. The startup is among just a handful of companies offering data brokering services. And even Human Native is only in the early stages of setting up its market, with a beta version of the platform currently available to select customers. Human Native plans to make money in several ways, including taking a commission on the transactions it brokers, as well as offering tools to help customers clean up datasets and implement data governance policies. The company has not disclosed if it is currently making any revenue from its nascent platform. Others already offering data for sale to AI companies include Nomad Data and data analytics platform Snowflake. But Human Native may soon face more competition. For instance, Matthew Prince, the founder and CEO of the computing company Cloudflare, has talked about creating a similar marketplace for AI data. To work, Human Native needs to build a critical mass of buyers and sellers on its platform, and create those standardized contract terms. Which is where the startup’s recent hiring of some well-pedigreed experts from the worlds of digital partnerships and IP law comes in. The hires include Madhav Chinnappa, who spent a decade working for the rights and development department at the BBC and then spent 13 years at Google running the search giant’s partnerships with news organizations, who is now Human Native’s vice president of partnerships; Tim Palmer, a veteran of Disney and Google, where he also spent 13 years, mostly working on product partnerships, who is now advising on partnerships and business development for Human Native; and Matt Hervey, a former partner at the international law firm Growling WLG who co-chaired the AI subcommittee of the American Intellectual Property Law Association and edited a new book on the legal issues surrounding AI. Hervey is now Human Native’s head of legal and policy. Both Palmer and Chinnappa were let go from Google during its large round of lay-offs in the summer of 2024, highlighting the extent to which that tech giant’s belt tightening has resulted in the loss of experienced employees who are now helping to grow a new generation of startups. “Human Native is focused on what is maybe the most interesting problem in tech right now,” Palmer told me, explaining why he was interested in helping the nascent data marketplace. He said that while lawsuits represented one attempt to establish rules for how AI companies can use data, commercial licensing represented a more productive approach. Palmer said his experience at Google acquiring content means he has “a good idea of what is out there and who has what content and who are the professional licensors and a good sense of what is acceptable and what is not” as far as licensing terms. Chinnappa said he sees Human Native as helping to level the playing field, especially for smaller publishers’ and rights holders, who he says might otherwise get frozen out of any deal with AI companies. “I helped write the playbook for this when I was at Google, and what you do [if you are Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, or one of the other big AI model companies] is you do a minimum number of big deals with big media companies,” he said. Human Native may be able to help smaller publishers find ways to monetize their data by helping to pool data from multiple publishers into packages that will be large enough, or tailored enough, to interest AI model makers, he said. Hervey said that Human Native could play a major role in helping to establish norms and standardized contracts for data licensing for AI. “The broader piece here is not about the law but market practice and the amazing opportunity we have to influence market practice,” he said. Palmer said it would take time for Human Native to be able to create a technology platform that makes purchasing data for AI models truly seamless. “It is not eBay yet,” he said. “It’s not a zero human touch proposition.” For now, while Human Native’s own staff is working to source datasets for AI companies, realizing that it needs a critical mass of both buyers and sellers on its platform for it to function. And, once it has facilitated a match between a data seller and an AI model company, the startup’s staff is also having to do a lot of work with both to help them strike a deal. Hervey said that some of the commercial terms will always be bespoke, and that Human Native wants to be able to support bespoke licensing arrangements, as well as working to try to standardize licensing terms.

2024-10-15T18:04:14+00:00,"OpenAI’s lead over other AI companies has largely vanished, ‘State of AI’ report finds",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-lead-over-other-ai-180414151.html,"Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition…AI's fast-falling cost…Google goes nuclear…LLMs may be dumber than you think…and a filmmaker burned by genAI backlash.

Every year for the past seven, Nathan Benaich, the founder and solo general partner at the early-stage AI investment firm Air Street Capital, has produced a magisterial “State of AI” report. Benaich and his collaborators marshal an impressive array of data to provide a great snapshot of the technology’s evolving capabilities, the landscape of companies developing it, a survey of how AI is being deployed, and a critical examination of the challenges still facing the field.

One of the big takeaways from this year’s report, which was published late last week, is that OpenAI’s lead over other AI labs has largely eroded. Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google’s Gemini 1.5, X’s Grok 2, and even Meta’s open-source Llama 3.1 405 B model have equaled, or narrowly surpassed on some benchmarks, OpenAI’s GPT-4o.

But, on the other hand, OpenAI still retains an edge for the moment on reasoning tasks with the release of its o1 “Strawberry” model—which Air Street’s report rightly characterized as a weird mix of incredibly strong logical abilities for some tasks, and surprisingly weak ones for others. (For more on the fragility of o1’s reasoning abilities, see the “Research” section below.)

Another big takeaway, Benaich told me, is the extent to which the cost of using a trained AI model—an activity known as ""inference""—is falling rapidly. There are several reasons for this. One is linked to that first big takeaway: With models less differentiated from one another on capabilities and performance, companies are forced to compete on price.

Another reason is that engineers for companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic—and their hyperscaler partners Microsoft and AWS, respectively—are discovering ways to optimize how the largest models run on big GPU clusters. The cost of outputs from OpenAI’s GPT-4o today is 100-times less per token (which is about equivalent to 1.5 words) than it was for GPT-4 when that model debuted in March 2023. Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro now costs 76% less per output token than it did when that model was launched in February 2024.

AI researchers have also become good at creating small AI models that can equal the performance of larger LLMs on dialogue, summarization, or even coding, while being much cheaper to run. Taken together, these two trends mean that the economics of implementing AI-based solutions are starting to look much more attractive than they did a year ago. This may ultimately help businesses find the return on investment from generative AI that they have complained has been elusive so far.

Another key trend Benaich picks up on is how robotics is coming back into vogue, with robotics companies marrying LLMs and new “world models” to existing tech to make significant progress in making robots more capable and easier (as well as cheaper) to deploy and customize. Benaich’s State of AI report always ends with some bold predictions for the year ahead (and Benaich grades himself each year on how he’s done.) Among the things he got right last year: that a Hollywood production would make use of genAI models for visual effects and that there would be limited progress on international AI governance efforts. Among those he got wrong: that a company would spend more than $1 billion training a single LLM. This year, among the report's predictions, are that an open source alternative to OpenAI’s o1 will surpass it across a range of benchmarks and that a $10 billion investment from a sovereign state into a U.S. AI company will cause the U.S. government to institute a national security review. We’ll check back next year to see how Benaich did. The State of AI report is not the only way to find a fantastic overview of what’s happening in AI. Another great place to gain a vantage point on AI’s rapidly evolving landscape and find out how AI is impacting business is Fortune’s upcoming Brainstorm AI conference in San Francisco. This must-attend annual event is coming up on December 9 and 10, held at the St. Regis Hotel. This year’s conference will include conversations with, among many others: Amazon’s head scientist for artificial general intelligence, Rohit Prasad, who will update us on how the Everything Store is trying to ensure it doesn’t get left behind in the race to build superpowerful—and super useful—AI; Liz Reid, Google’s vice president of search, who will discuss the future of Google’s signature product in an AI world; Christopher Young, Microsoft’s executive vice president of business development, strategy, and ventures, who will discuss how the tech giant is trying to see around corners to what is coming next for AI; Daniela Braga, the founder and CEO of Defined.ai who will tell us what it really takes to build AI models that work for customers; and Colin Kaepernick, former Super Bowl quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and current founder and CEO of Lumi, a company that builds AI-powered tools for content creators, who will speak about his own transformation from professional athlete to entrepreneur, and what AI may mean for influencers, brands, and beyond.

The analyst writes that Google patent Alphabet is well positioned long term with leading AI technology to apply to search, YouTube, and Cloud businesses.

As per Post, Alphabet should also benefit from increasing mobile usage, video usage, Google Play activity, and connected device activity (including autos).

Also Read: What’s Going On With Oklo Stock Tuesday?

The analyst writes that Alphabet should trade at a premium to a media peer group, given technology leadership, high margins, and strong cash flow generation for buybacks.

The price target reflects 22 times 2025 core Google GAAP EPS plus cash per share. Alphabet has traded at an average multiple of 22 times GAAP P/E over the last ten years, and Post noted that his multiple is reasonable compared to history, given expectations for double-digit revenue growth, Cloud margin expansion, and the opportunity to capitalize on strong AI assets.

Post noted a higher probability of new disclosures with a new CFO, but more likely on the December call.

The third-quarter potential positives included Search strength suggesting AI drives higher monetization, positive commentary on Al overviews driving higher usage or new advertising opportunities, YouTube benefit from political spending and brand stabilization, and Cloud strength from strong AI demand and capacity constraints at competitors.

There is potential for the company to “surprise” with further self-help cost-cutting actions after limited layoffs in 2024.

Moreover, with an attractive core valuation despite big AI assets, he noted that many concerns are already priced “in” the stock. While the analyst doesn’t anticipate significant multiple expansion given regulatory overhangs, he noted that the stock can appreciate with earnings growth.

Alphabet is scheduled to report third-quarter results on October 29 after market close. Post expects revenue of $72.7 billion versus the Street consensus of $72.8 billion and EPS of $1.86 against the Street consensus of $1.85.

The analyst projects third-quarter revenues of $49.4 billion for Search (slightly above Street at $49.1 billion). For YouTube, he projected revenue of $8.82 billion and for Cloud at $10.9 billion, both in line with Street.

The updated shopping experience largely revolves around scrollable feeds akin to a social media app. A new home page will display a personalized feed of products, reviews and auto-playing video shorts from Google’s YouTube. A Deals page will host a similar curated feed of discounted items.

Searches on Google Shopping will return artificial intelligence-generated blurbs explaining important factors to consider for specific merchandise, like the type of material of a jacket meant for a wet climate. The features will initially be available in the US.

The redesign is the company’s latest move to keep users on Google’s platform longer when researching anything from recipes to flights, rather than immediately diverting them to external websites. In May, the company introduced AI Overviews, which summarize the contents of search results, a feature some critics argue could reduce clicks through to websites that earn ad revenue from visits.

Alphabet shares rose less than 1% to $165.79 at 11:45 a.m. Tuesday in New York. The stock had jumped 18% this year through Monday’s close.

Unlike the digital marketplaces of fellow technology giants Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Google Shopping doesn’t sell or ship products; it just shows customers where they can buy items.

“We see ourselves playing a different role” than Amazon, Maria Renz, Google vice president and general manager of commerce, said in an interview prior to the announcement. “Google has always been about promoting a healthy ecosystem.”

Shoppers can fully research a potential purchase without ever leaving Google’s variety of websites — from viewing suggested items on Google Shopping to watching product review videos on YouTube to locating brick-and-mortar sellers on Google Maps.

But the company’s suite of heavily integrated products could be at risk. After a landmark antitrust ruling found Google illegally monopolized the search market, the US Justice Department is considering calling for a breakup that could spin off major parts of the company’s portfolio, including the Chrome internet browser and the Android operating system.",GOOGL,yes,eod,479
2024-10-15T15:05:45+00:00,Google will help build seven nuclear reactors to power its AI systems,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-help-build-seven-nuclear-150545854.html,"Google is adding nuclear plants to its seemingly ever-growing portfolio. The company has partnered with Kairos Power to back the construction of seven small nuclear reactors in the U.S. It’s the first agreement of its kind.

The first plant is expected to come online by 2030, the company announced in a blog post. Other reactors will be deployed by 2035. All totaled, the deal will funnel 500 megawatts of power to the company’s AI technologies—enough to power a midsize city.

“Nuclear solutions offer a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands with carbon-free energy every hour of every day,” Google wrote in the blog post. “Advancing these power sources in close partnership with supportive local communities will rapidly drive the decarbonization of electricity grids around the world.”

The smaller reactors created by Kairos, a nuclear-energy startup, are different from the towers most people think of when they conjure up an image of a nuclear reactor. The company uses a molten salt cooling system (much like the one that will be used for the on-site reactor being built on the campus of Abilene Christian University), which operates at a lower pressure. The company broke ground on a demonstration reactor, which will be unpowered, earlier this year in Tennessee.

Google did not unveil the cost of the partnership. The project site (or sites) have not yet been determined.

Google’s announcement comes weeks after Microsoft announced a partnership with Constellation Energy that will see the undamaged reactor at Three Mile Island, the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history, resume operations to power Microsoft’s AI data centers.

Experts have warned data centers could become a big strain on the U.S. power grid, with the nine-year projected growth forecast for North America essentially doubling from where it stood a year ago. Last year, the five-year forecast from Grid Strategies projected growth of 2.6%. That number has since nearly doubled to 4.7%—and planners expect peak demand to grow by 38 gigawatts. In real-world terms, that’s sufficient to power 12.7 million homes.

2024-10-15T13:00:47+00:00,Google Shopping is getting an AI upgrade as Alphabet looks to monetize investments,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-shopping-is-getting-an-ai-upgrade-as-alphabet-looks-to-monetize-investments-130047201.html,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is giving its Google Shopping page an artificial intelligence upgrade. The shopping site will now include AI-powered summaries powered by the company's Gemini AI model that offer tips on how to shop for the best option for the product you’re searching for. It will also get new personalized results and personalized deals pages.

Google says the AI summaries will appear in a new module near the top of the screen just below the sponsored products list and provide information about what kind of features to look for when shopping for products and why.

Shares of Google were largely flat on the day.

If you're shopping for a kettle for making matcha tea, for example, the AI summaries box will tell you that you should look for kettles with a gooseneck spout for controlled pouring and precise temperature controls. Below that, you’ll see a number of recommendations for products that include bits of information from those AI summaries.

In the tea kettle example, Google Shopping highlighted things like ""gooseneck"" and ""temperature control"" found in the recommended products' descriptions, making it easier to understand why Google suggested those options.

In another example showing a person searching for the best men’s winter jacket for the Pacific Northwest, the AI recommendation feature explained that coats that offer both warmth and water resistance are best for the region’s famously rainy weather.

Google says users shop more than 1 billion times per day using Google, making this a massive opportunity for Google to prove that its AI upgrades are worthwhile for everyday users.

In addition to the AI recommendations, Google said it’s adding a personalized shopping feed to the Google Shopping homepage based on products that users have previously shown an interest in. Google says personalized recommendations can also be turned off via Google Shopping's settings menu.

The Deals page, meanwhile, will include personalized deals for products and goods.

In addition to Google Shopping, Google has added its Gemini models to its main Google Search product via its AI Overviews feature, as well as a number of its Android apps for smartphones. But it hasn’t been easy going for the company. In May, Google faced considerable backlash, and plenty of mockery, when users found that AI Overviews told them they could eat rocks and put glue on their pizzas.

Google responded by scaling back its rollout to address the issues and ensure the feature doesn’t surface unreliable information.

Google’s updates come as the company seeks to monetize its vast investments in generative AI technologies. In the second quarter, Google’s parent company Alphabet reported spending $2.2 billion building AI models across its DeepMind and Google Research organizations. That's up from $1.1 billion in Q2 2023.",GOOGL,yes,eod,537

""Google is very interested,"" Undersecretary Alessio Butti told reporters on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting of the Group of Seven advanced democracies. ""We are holding talks over base stations in Sicily.""

Google is already partnering with Telecom Italia's (TIM) submarine cable unit, known as Sparkle, to operate two submarine cable systems linking the Middle East with southern Europe and Asia.

TIM this month entered exclusive talks with Italy's Treasury and its partner Asterion to sell Sparkle by Nov. 30.

The US search engine giant has ordered a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) from California’s Kairos Power, with each mini-nuke capable of generating 500 megawatts (MW) of low-carbon electricity.

California-based Kairos said its first commercial reactor will come online by 2030, with additional reactors operational by 2035.

Google’s decision to embrace nuclear comes as the expansion of AI increases the tech sector’s energy requirements.

Michael Terrell, senior director for energy and climate at Google, said: “The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies that are powering major scientific advances, improving services for businesses and customers, and driving national competitiveness and economic growth.

“This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably, and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone.”

He added: “Nuclear solutions offer a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands with carbon-free energy every hour of every day.”

This latest acquisition comes after Microsoft agreed last month to buy at least 20 years of energy generated by a power plant in Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania.

The plant, which saw the worst nuclear accident in America’s history unfold in 1979, will be reopened in 2028 as part of the deal.

This followed an agreement struck by Amazon in March to buy a 960MW nuclear-powered data centre from Talen Energy, also in Pennsylvania, for $650m (£498m).

SMRs are viewed as a promising solution for decarbonising heavy industrial operations while providing a stable power source. The reactors are factory-made and assembled on-site.

In the UK, Rolls-Royce is among the companies seeking to expand in the SMR space by developing a design it hopes to sell globally.

However, its mini-nuclear reactor business posted a £78m loss last week while awaiting the outcome of a delayed UK tender competition.

Each of Rolls’s mini-nuclear reactors is eventually expected to sell for between £2bn and £3bn.",GOOGL,yes,eod,438
2024-10-25 18:40:09,"Cramer's week ahead: Earnings from Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/25/cramers-week-ahead-earnings-from-alphabet-meta-apple-microsoft-and-amazon.html,"With massive corporations including Alphabet , Meta , Apple , Microsoft and Amazon set to report earnings next week, CNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday urged investors to keep a level head. He also said not to forget about the nonfarm payroll report next Friday, where a weak hiring result could urge the Federal Reserve to keep cutting rates.

""Huge opportunity,"" he said. ""Just please remember, the first move's been the wrong move almost half the time since this earnings season began. Wait to process the numbers and listen to the conference calls before you pull the trigger.""

Monday starts off the week with earnings from Ford . Cramer said he wishes the automaker giant will report a clean quarter with no issues from warranty costs and not too much lost on electric vehicles.

Tuesday brings McDonald's earnings report, and Cramer said to expect ""a full airing of the e-coli situation,"" but that it is too early to tell how much damage it will do to the fast food chain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states. 



Cramer predicts Royal Caribbean , Reddit and PayPal to all report a large beat and raise in year-end guidance.

Alphabet will report after the close on Tuesday. While the tech behemoth's stock has been all over the map, Cramer said it has been ""rarely in a good way."" He said Alphabet is a great company, but not a solid stock as the leadership doesn't seem to prioritize what investors want to hear. 



Cramer said he believes Advanced Micro Devices will do well enough to take parts of Nvidia's business. Chipotle will report its earnings for the first time since former-CEO Brian Niccol's left the helm to run Starbucks , and Cramer said he believes announcing a permanent CEO would help the stock.

Another large slate of reports are set for Wednesday, including Caterpillar and Eli Lilly . Cramer said he saw the former's machines all over Chevron's floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico, but isn't sure whether the likely strong report will be enough to move the already hot stock. The latter has had a strong run on the back of the GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, and Cramer said a Stifel report on the negative impact weight-loss drugs may have on food stock means Eli Lilly stocks will benefit. 



Meta and Microsoft will dominate the after-the-bell reports, and while Cramer said he believes Meta can continue its phenomenal quarterly run, he isn't too sure whether Microsoft will be able to convince investors that its AI-tool Copilot is as strong as advertised. Two more companies Cramer said will likely show a hot quarter, Booking Holding and DoorDash , will shed more light on consumers prior to the nonfarm payroll report.

The monster week for earnings will continue into Thursday, as both Apple and Amazon will report after the bell. Even after the lackluster iPhone 16 launch, Cramer said ""we've seen this movie before"" with the company and the best strategy is to hold on. 



Another moment not to panic, he said Amazon is doing well and not to dogpile on the potential hammering the stock received last quarter. Cramer said he believes two drug stocks, Merck and Bristol-Myers , are too low, but if Friday brings a weak employment number then they are two stocks investors should not have bought.

On Friday, the nonfarm payroll report will be released, and Cramer said he ""can't stress how important this number is."" He said continued strong employment will mean no November interest rate cut, and even though some investors will want to sell, fed rate cut cycles are times to buy. Oil titans Chevron and Exxon will report the same day. 



Cramer said he was impressed on his trip by the way Chevron's returned a huge amount of capital in dividends and buybacks even though it is still the worst performer in the group. He also said Exxon is more loved than Chevron from the battle over the Hess acquisition, even as Exxon doesn't have as much earnings power, and suggested people should switch sides.",MSFT,yes,fmp,838

Stock awards for Nadella, who earned $48.5 million in 2023, climbed to about $71 million from $39 million a year earlier, according an SEC filing.

The raise comes after Microsoft shed 1,900 people from its gaming workforce following the company’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

Months later, it shuttered another gamer firm, Arkane Austin, and handed out pink slips to 650 employees.

Nonetheless, Nadella was rewarded with a significant windfall that would have been higher had it not been for cybersecurity breaches that got the attention of Congress.

Nadella asked for a pay cut that shaved $5.5 million off of his total compensation for fiscal year 2024 because of cyberattacks that rocked the software giant, which the government has alleged can be traced back to Russia and China.

A cash incentive that Nadella was in line to receive, which was tied mostly to revenue and operating income targets, was slashed from $10.66 million to $5.2 million, according to the filing, first cited by CNBC.

Microsoft said in its filing that Nadella asked the company’s compensation committee to take the security breaches into account when determining his pay.

“Mr. Nadella agreed that the Company’s performance was extremely strong, but reflecting on his personal commitment to security and his role as the CEO, asked the Board to consider departing from the established performance metrics and reduce his cash incentive to reflect his personal accountability for the focus and speed required for the changes that today’s cybersecurity threat landscape showed were necessary,” the committee wrote.

Lawmakers in June grilled Microsoft President Brad Smith about the tech giant’s security practices and ties to China a year after alleged China-linked hackers spied on federal emails by hacking the firm.

The hackers accessed 60,000 State Department emails by breaking into Microsoft’s systems in the summer of 2023, while Russia-linked cybercriminals separately spied on Microsoft’s senior staff emails this year, according to the company’s disclosures.

Microsoft, the world’s biggest software-maker, is also a key vendor to the US government and national security establishment.

Microsoft’s business accounts for around 3% of the US federal IT budget, Smith said at the hearing.

Lawmakers grilled Microsoft for its inability to prevent both the Russian and Chinese hacks, which they said put federal networks at risk despite not using sophisticated means.

In May, Nadella circulated a memo to employees titled “Prioritizing security above all else.”

“If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security,” Nadella wrote.

Microsoft said that it would take into account employees’ contributions to cybersecurity when determining compensation.

Despite the hacks, Nadella has delivered for investors. Since Jan. 1, Microsoft’s stock has risen by more than 16% — though it still lags the S&P 500, which has yielded gains of more than 23% year-to-date.

Microsoft is scheduled to report its latest quarterly earnings next week.

The consensus view among Wall Street analysts is that the company notched a 3% year-over-year increase in earnings per share as well as a 14% rise in revenues compared to the same period a year ago.

As of Friday, Microsoft, with a market capitalization of $3.2 trillion, was the third most valuable company in the world behind Nvidia, which leapfrogged Apple.",MSFT,yes,fmp,729

Mats, a Norwegian World of Warcraft player known in game as Ibelin, suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In the wake of his death at age 25, his family discovered what they thought was a life lived in total isolation was in fact filled with joy, laughter, friendship and love through Mats' adventures in World of Warcraft. The game opened a world of community and connection his family never knew existed and gave him a rich set of friends and experiences that would not have been possible outside of the game environment. Mats was a supportive friend and trusted advisor who made a tremendous impact on the lives of all he encountered in the game.

World of Warcraft players will have the opportunity to build on Mats' legacy and adopt a limited-edition pet in World of Warcraft to accompany them on their adventures while supporting CureDuchenne's mission of improving and extending the lives of those with Duchenne muscular dystrophy around the world. The Reven Pack, available for US$20 now through January 7, 2025, features an adorable fox pet, Reven (""fox"" in Norwegian), for both modern World of Warcraft and Classic Progression realms.

One hundred percent of the purchase price* will be donated to CureDuchenne to accelerate research toward a cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and improve care for individuals worldwide living with the disease.

""We are immensely grateful to Blizzard Entertainment and World of Warcraft for their partnership to fund critical research that will bring us closer to a cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and support families living with Duchenne around the world,"" said Debra Miller, founder and CEO of CureDuchenne. ""Mats Steen brought hope and support to so many who were lucky enough to know him but, like many with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, he left his loved ones far too soon. With the generous support of the World of Warcraft community, we will be able to help will help more boys and young men like Mats live longer, stronger lives.""

""Mats Steen lived a life in World of Warcraft that he couldn't in the real world as he fought Duchenne muscular dystrophy alongside his incredible family, who I'm proud to have met and fallen in love with,"" said Holly Longdale, executive producer of World of Warcraft. ""Working with CureDuchenne for our Charity Pet Program, in honor of Mats' memory, allows us to harness the power of our phenomenal global community to bring meaningful impact to so many lives.""

Revenues are expected to be $64.41 billion, up 14% from the year-ago quarter.

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone a downward revision of 0.1% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.

Prior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.

While investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.

MSFT prepares to release its first quarter earnings on Oct. 30, the tech giant's AI and cloud services will be in the spotlight. Analysts estimate earnings per share at $3.09 and revenue of $64.48 billion.

Microsoft stock is up 24.67% over the past year, 14.52% YTD. Investors will be keen to see if Microsoft’s focus on AI and cloud can offset growing concerns over its high capital expenditures (CapEx).

• Mark Cuban believes “the next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment” — this new real estate fund allows you to get started with just $100.

As first quarter earnings approach, Microsoft's ability to turn its CapEx investments into tangible growth will be scrutinized. While Azure's rapid expansion continues, Microsoft’s management will need to address how these investments in AI and cloud are paying off, especially in the face of economic uncertainty and potential regulatory scrutiny.

The stock might continue its streak as the charts remain bullish.

Microsoft stock at $424.73 is trading above the eight-day, 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages, signaling ongoing buying pressure.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator sits at 0.17, suggesting a continued upward trend. However, with an RSI of 55.05 and rising, Microsoft stock could soon be approaching overbought territory, which could signal potential near-term volatility.

In the fourth quarter, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud business posted a 19% revenue increase, driven by Azure's 29% growth, with AI services playing a crucial role. As the company ramps up investments in data centers and AI infrastructure to meet demand, investors are questioning whether these hefty CapEx expenses will deliver returns soon enough to sustain Microsoft’s stock momentum.

Microsoft’s bet on AI is substantial — management projects a $3.50 return for every $1 invested in AI. With generative AI revenues expected to surge from $5.3 billion in 2024 to $35 billion by 2027, the company is positioning itself as a leader in the AI-driven cloud market.

However, the timeline for these returns remains a key question for analysts, especially with concerns over macroeconomic headwinds and fierce competition from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud.

What To Watch For

While Microsoft’s AI and cloud focus offers long-term growth potential, investors will be closely watching the first quarter earnings for signs of near-term profitability and ROI on its significant CapEx investments.

With Microsoft stock is trading at bullish technical levels, any further acceleration in cloud or AI growth could push the stock higher, though CapEx concerns may continue to weigh on sentiment.

• The tech leader requested a lower cash incentive than planned after several cybersecurity breaches.
• Microsoft stock has soared as investors bet it'll be a big winner from the AI boom.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's compensation surged 63% to $79.1 million for the financial year ended June 30 — and would likely have been higher without his intervention.

The software giant's boss received a $2.5 million salary, $71.2 million of stock awards, a $5.2 million cash incentive, and $170,000 in other compensation, per a proxy filing on Thursday. He was paid a total of $48.5 million in the previous financial year.

Nadella had been in line for a $10.7 million cash incentive, but asked the board for less following several high-profile cybersecurity breaches in the period.

""Mr. Nadella agreed that the Company's performance was extremely strong, but reflecting on his personal commitment to security and his role as the CEO, asked the Board to consider departing from the established performance metrics and reduce his cash incentive to reflect his personal accountability for the focus and speed required for the changes that today's cybersecurity threat landscape showed were necessary,"" the filing reads.

Nadella's stock award was worth $39 million for the previous year. Microsoft stock soared more than 30% in the 12 months to June, boosting its market value to north of $3 trillion as well as the value of the CEO's options.

The stock has enjoyed a stellar run as investors wagered that Microsoft, an investor in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, would be a key beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom.

Revenue jumped 16% to $245 billion in the period, driving operating income up 24% to $109 billion.

Nadella's compensation is comparable to that of other Big Tech leaders. Apple CEO Tim Cook was paid $63.2 million for the company's last financial year, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang pocketed $34.2 million.",MSFT,yes,fmp,432
2024-10-25 05:21:00,2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Billionaire Money Managers Are Choosing Over Nvidia,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/25/2-ai-stocks-billionaire-money-choosing-over-nvidia/,"More than a half-dozen prominent billionaire investors are selling shares of Wall Street darling Nvidia in favor of two rapidly growing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.

Wall Street has been waiting decades for the next game-changing innovation to rival what the internet did for corporate America in the mid-1990s. After a long wait, artificial intelligence (AI) looks to have answered the call.

The ability for AI-driven software and systems to become more proficient at their tasks over time, as well as learn new skills without human intervention, gives this technology almost limitless potential. According to Sizing the Prize, the analysts at PwC see AI adding $15.7 trillion to the global economy through various production improvements and consumption-side effects by 2030.

But while no company has benefited more directly from the rise of AI than semiconductor titan Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%), quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show billionaire money managers are consistently choosing two other AI stocks over Wall Street's darling.

More than a half-dozen billionaire investors have been sellers of Nvidia stock

Nvidia has been able to ride its first-mover advantages to a nearly $3.2 trillion increase in market cap since the start of 2023. To date, its AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) hold a veritable market share monopoly in high-compute data centers.

Despite this competitive edge, more than a half-dozen billionaires were decisive sellers of Nvidia stock during the June-ended quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):

Taking into account Nvidia's historic climb of well over 800% in roughly 22 months, profit-taking likely accounts for some of this selling activity. But there may be more to this selling than meets the eye.

For example, U.S. regulators have been limiting Nvidia's sales and profit potential over the last two years. Regulators have restricted exports of the company's high-powered AI chips to China, which is one of Nvidia's top-dollar markets.

Insider activity has been another sore spot for Nvidia. While there are plenty of reasons for high-ranking executives and board members to sell, some of which are benign, there's only reason for insiders to purchase stock -- they expect the share price to head higher. December will mark four years since the last open-market purchase from an Nvidia insider. Meanwhile, there have been 83 insider sales over the trailing-12-month period.

Nvidia can also expect competition to slowly chip away at its leading data-center market share. New entrants into the AI-GPU arena, coupled with Nvidia's largest customers all internally developing AI chips of their own, would be expected to adversely impact Nvidia's, thus far, otherworldly pricing power and margins.

Lastly, no market leader of a next-big-thing innovation has avoided a bubble-bursting event over the last 30 years. Investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption of new technologies, and nothing suggests AI is going to be the exception.

Rather than hold shares of Nvidia, billionaire money managers have consistently chosen to buy the following two artificial intelligence stocks instead.

The first AI stock that billionaires clearly preferred over Nvidia in the second quarter is customizable rack server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer (SMCI 2.25%). Based on the latest 13F filings, a half-dozen billionaire asset managers were buyers of Super Micro, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis and adjusted for the company's 10-for-1 stock split at the end of September):

The logical reason for investors to buy into the Super Micro growth story is that businesses wanting first-mover advantages in the AI arena will need to rapidly expand their data-center infrastructure. Super Micro is the logical choice to make that happen, as evidenced by the 110% net sales growth the company delivered in fiscal 2024 (ended June 30), and the 87% sales growth, based on the midpoint of its guidance, expected for the current fiscal year.

What makes this somewhat of an odd selection for billionaires is that Super Micro Computer's rack servers incorporate Nvidia's H100 GPUs. On one hand, this acts as a dangling carrot that keeps its infrastructure in high demand. Conversely, it puts Super Micro at the mercy of its suppliers, including Nvidia, which is dealing with backlogged orders for its GPUs.

I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that noted short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report in late August alleging ""accounting manipulation"" at Super Micro. Despite the company denying these allegations, reports have surfaced that the U.S. Justice Department is conducting an early stage probe. To boot, Super Micro delayed filing its annual report, which is raising eyebrows on Wall Street -- and not in a good way.

There's no question that Super Micro Computer's stock is historically cheap, based on forward-year earnings per share (EPS) estimates; but there are also some very big questions that need answers before this stock gets a clean bill of health.

A second artificial intelligence stock billionaires are consistently choosing over Nvidia is one of only three $3 trillion businesses, Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%). During the June-ended quarter, eight prominent billionaire money managers purchased shares of Microsoft, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):
• David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (177,726 shares)

Whereas Nvidia and Super Micro Computer represent the backbone of the AI revolution, Microsoft is viewed as a beneficiary based on the utility of the AI solutions it's incorporating into its services. For example, Microsoft incorporated AI into its search engine (Bing) and web browser (Edge) with the assistance of OpenAI, the company behind the ultra-popular chatbot, ChatGPT. Microsoft happens to be a notable investor in OpenAI.

Additionally, Microsoft plans to lean on AI solutions within its rapidly growing cloud infrastructure service platform, Azure. Giving its enterprise clients the ability to build and train large language models, as well as run generative Ai solutions, should help Azure sustain double-digit sales growth and, at worst, maintain its position as the global No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform.

Beyond AI, billionaire asset managers are likely impressed with Microsoft's cash flow machine. Although legacy segments like Office and Windows aren't the growth stories they once were, their impressive market share and juicy margins continue to deliver.

The exorbitant amount of cash generated from Microsoft's operations affords the company the ability to take risks. Microsoft is no stranger to making big acquisitions, and ended fiscal 2024 (June 30) with more than $75 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.

If the AI bubble were to burst, Microsoft would have the sales channels and cash in place to weather the storm much better than Nvidia.",MSFT,yes,fmp,1360

But his total package would have been $5.5 million higher if not for a series of cyberattacks.

Nadella received $79.1 million for the fiscal year that ended June 30, up from $48.5 million in the prior year, according to a proxy filing Thursday. Most of his pay is in the form of stock. The board's compensation committee said Nadella asked that the cash incentive portion reflect the security issues.

The requested reduction came after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in April published a report that followed an independent review of China's breach of U.S. government officials' email accounts. Microsoft disclosed that incident in July 2023.

In January, Microsoft said Russian intelligence had accessed some of the company's top executives' email accounts.

Microsoft said it would revamp its practices to address shortcomings highlighted in the government report, which said ""customers would benefit from its CEO and board of directors directly focusing on the company's security culture.""

Nadella responded by telling employees in a May memo that Microsoft would prioritize security above all else. In June, Microsoft said it would consider employees' cybersecurity efforts when determining their compensation.

The cash incentive part of Nadella's pay mostly takes into account the software maker's performance in relation to revenue and operating income targets. It was originally supposed to be $10.66 million, but the full board approved a $5.2 million cash incentive instead.

""Mr. Nadella agreed that the Company's performance was extremely strong, but reflecting on his personal commitment to security and his role as the CEO, asked the Board to consider departing from the established performance metrics and reduce his cash incentive to reflect his personal accountability for the focus and speed required for the changes that today's cybersecurity threat landscape showed were necessary,"" the committee wrote.

On Wednesday, Miles Brundage, senior advisor for AGI Readiness, announced his departure from the company via a Substack post. He wrote that his primary reasons were that the opportunity cost had become too high and he thought his research would be more impactful externally, that he wanted to be less biased and that he had accomplished what he set out to do at OpenAI.

Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a branch of AI pursuing technology that equals or surpasses human intellect on a wide range of tasks. AGI is a hotly debated topic, with some leaders saying we're close to attaining it and some saying it's not possible at all.

In his post, Brundage also wrote, ""Neither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready.""

Brundage said he plans to start his own nonprofit, or join an existing one, to focus on AI policy research and advocacy. ""AI is unlikely to be as safe and beneficial as possible without a concerted effort to make it so,"" he said.

Former AGI Readiness team members will be reassigned to other teams, according to Brundage's post.

""We fully support Miles' decision to pursue his policy research outside industry and are deeply grateful for his contributions,"" an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC. ""His plan to go all-in on independent research on AI policy gives him the opportunity to have an impact on a wider scale, and we are excited to learn from his work and follow its impact. We're confident that in his new role, Miles will continue to raise the bar for the quality of policymaking in industry and government.""

In May, OpenAI disbanded its Superalignment team — which OpenAI said focused on ""scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us"" to prevent them ""from going rogue"" — just one year after it announced the group, a person familiar with the situation confirmed to CNBC at the time.

News of the AGI Readiness team's disbandment follows the OpenAI board's potential plans to restructure the firm to a for-profit business, and after three executives — CTO Mira Murati, research chief Bob McGrew and research VP Barret Zoph — announced their departure on the same day in September.

In early October, OpenAI closed its buzzy funding round at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and Big Tech companies. It also received a $4 billion revolving line of credit, bringing its total liquidity to more than $10 billion. The company expects about $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue this year, CNBC confirmed in September with a person familiar with the situation.

In September, OpenAI announced that its Safety and Security Committee, which the company introduced in May as it dealt with controversy over security processes, would become an independent board oversight committee. It recently wrapped up its 90-day review evaluating OpenAI's processes and safeguards and then made recommendations to the board, with the findings also released in a public blog post.

News of the executive departures and board changes also follows a summer of mounting safety concerns and controversies surrounding OpenAI, which along with Google, Microsoft , Meta and other companies is at the helm of a generative AI arms race — a market that is predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade — as companies in seemingly every industry rush to add AI-powered chatbots and agents, to avoid being left behind by competitors.

In July, OpenAI reassigned Aleksander Madry, one of OpenAI's top safety executives, to a job focused on AI reasoning instead, people familiar with the situation confirmed to CNBC at the time.

Madry was OpenAI's head of preparedness, a team that was ""tasked with tracking, evaluating, forecasting, and helping protect against catastrophic risks related to frontier AI models,"" according to a bio for Madry on a Princeton University AI initiative website. Madry will still work on core AI safety work in his new role, OpenAI told CNBC at the time.

The decision to reassign Madry came around the same time that Democratic senators sent a letter to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman concerning ""questions about how OpenAI is addressing emerging safety concerns.""

The letter, which was viewed by CNBC, also said, ""We seek additional information from OpenAI about the steps that the company is taking to meet its public commitments on safety, how the company is internally evaluating its progress on those commitments, and on the company's identification and mitigation of cybersecurity threats.""

Microsoft gave up its observer seat on OpenAI's board in July, writing in a letter viewed by CNBC that it can now step aside because it's satisfied with the construction of the startup's board, which had been revamped since the uprising that led to the brief ouster of Altman and threatened Microsoft's massive investment in the company.

But in June, a group of current and former OpenAI employees published an open letter describing concerns about the artificial intelligence industry's rapid advancement despite a lack of oversight and an absence of whistleblower protections for those who wish to speak up.

""AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this,"" the employees wrote at the time.

Days after the letter was published, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice were set to open antitrust investigations into OpenAI, Microsoft and Nvidia, focusing on the companies' conduct.

FTC Chair Lina Khan has described her agency's action as a ""market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.""

The current and former employees wrote in the June letter that AI companies have ""substantial non-public information"" about what their technology can do, the extent of the safety measures they've put in place and the risk levels that technology has for different types of harm.

""We also understand the serious risks posed by these technologies,"" they wrote, adding the companies ""currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.""

OpenAI's Superalignment team, announced last year and disbanded in May, had focused on ""scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us."" At the time, OpenAI said it would commit 20% of its computing power to the initiative over four years.

The team was disbanded after its leaders, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, announced their departures from the startup in May.

""Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor,"" Leike wrote in a post on X. ""OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity. But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.""

Altman said at the time on X he was sad to see Leike leave and that OpenAI had more work to do. Soon afterward, co-founder Greg Brockman posted on X a statement attributed to Brockman and the CEO, asserting the company has ""raised awareness of the risks and opportunities of AGI so that the world can better prepare for it.""

""I joined because I thought OpenAI would be the best place in the world to do this research,"" Leike wrote in his May post on X. ""However, I have been disagreeing with OpenAI leadership about the company's core priorities for quite some time, until we finally reached a breaking point.""

Leike wrote that he believes much more of the company's bandwidth should be focused on security, monitoring, preparedness, safety and societal impact.

""These problems are quite hard to get right, and I am concerned we aren't on a trajectory to get there,"" he wrote at the time. ""Over the past few months my team has been sailing against the wind. Sometimes we were struggling for [computing resources] and it was getting harder and harder to get this crucial research done.""

Leike added that OpenAI must become a ""safety-first AGI company.""",MSFT,yes,fmp,1717
2024-10-24 09:25:50,Microsoft pushes for gaming supremacy with 'Call of Duty' release,https://techxplore.com/news/2024-10-microsoft-gaming-supremacy-duty.html,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Microsoft's ambition to become the ""Netflix of video games"" faces a huge test this week with the release of ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 6"" on Friday.

The US software giant bought the game's publisher Activision-Blizzard a year ago for $69 billion in the sector's biggest takeover.

Activision's prized asset was the ""Call of Duty"" franchise, one of the world's best-selling games, and Friday's release will be the first in the series to be available from day one on Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscription service.

The game will also be available to PlayStation users—as well as on PC.

Mat Piscatella from analyst firm Circana told AFP it was ""the biggest push"" anyone had made to bolster a subscription platform.

Video game companies once made their money from selling hard copies of their games to players who were plugged into consoles.

But the industry now gets its profits from in-game sales and subscriptions on a model like Netflix or Disney+.

""How consumers react may result in a dramatic industry shift to—or away—from the subscription model,"" said Piscatella of the ""Call of Duty"" release.

'Something for everyone'

Microsoft is not messing about with its ambitions for Game Pass.

It has a target of 100 million customers by 2030.

But the industry has slowed since the boom-time of the pandemic when much of the world spent time confined to their homes.

As of February this year, Game Pass had around 34 million subscribers.

For Friday's release, Microsoft has rejigged its pricing and only subscribers to the most expensive ""Ultimate"" tier will get the game as it launches.

Despite the vital importance of the game to Microsoft's business, the makers were keen to promote the strengths of the game itself.

""There's really something for everyone with Black Ops 6,"" Stephanie Snowden, communications head at Call of Duty Studios, told AFP on the sidelines of a promotional event in London.

Players are plunged into an alternate reality of conspiracy and paranoia during the 1991 Gulf War.

But she insisted the game was not saying anything about contemporary divisions in the United States, or the forthcoming presidential election.

""We consider it like a giant blockbuster moment and entertainment moment of the year,"" she said. ""But we're not sending any kind of political message.""

The saga has generated more than $30 billion in revenue worldwide in a little over 20 years.

But Brian Comiskey of the Consumer Technology Association, an industry group, said Microsoft got more than just a straightforward gaming title when it bought Activision.

""It's not just a game, it's a community,"" he told AFP.

The first ""Call of Duty"" games were pioneers by allowing many players to join the same game online.

Many of those players have grown up together, playing the game with each other no matter where they are in the world.

""Video gaming is a social media platform and Call of Duty has been doing that for a very long time,"" said Comiskey.

So these older players may well get involved even if the game itself is not so impressive.

""The interest isn't necessarily always the content,"" he said. ""That's just a cherry on top.""",MSFT,yes,fmp,669

2024-10-24 08:30:01,"Chinese smartphone maker Oppo doubles down on AI, says in regular talks with Google and Microsoft",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/24/chinese-smartphone-maker-oppo-in-weekly-ai-talks-with-google-microsoft.html,"BEIJING — Chinese smartphone company Oppo is doubling down on artificial intelligence as it holds weekly talks about AI with senior management at Google and Microsoft in the run-up to the launch of its flagship phone overseas. The collaborations are part of the race to build the next artificial intelligence application. The rise of generative AI — tech that can produce human-like responses when prompted — has companies from Apple to Honeywell rushing to tap its capabilities. ""Google will also come to China to ask us, what needs and pain points do you have with your products? Let's solve them together,"" Billy Zhang, president of Oppo's overseas market, sales and services, told reporters last week at the company's office in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. ""We know consumers' needs, and we will use AI to satisfy [them],"" Zhang said. The company is expanding further in Europe, but does not have immediate plans for the U.S., he said. Oppo, which owns the OnePlus brand too, said around 60% of its shipments come from Southeast Asia, Europe and other overseas markets. The company ranked fourth globally in terms of smartphone shipments in the third quarter, making up 9% of all units shipped, according to Canalys. Samsung and Apple were tied for the first spot, followed by Xiaomi .

While the U.S. leads in terms of AI capabilities, experts suggest Chinese companies will have an edge when it comes to consumer applications of the tech. That's despite U.S. restrictions on exports of high-end chips to China. Oppo has said the global version of its forthcoming flagship smartphone will be equipped with AI writing and recording summary tools from Google's Gemini, and text-to-speech features from Microsoft. Microsoft employs OpenAI products such as ChatGPT. It was not immediately clear to what extent existing Oppo models use AI tools from the two tech companies. Oppo announced Thursday its new flagship Find X8 series is ""coming soon"" to global markets. But the company has yet to specify when.

Oppo in June announced it plans to integrate generative AI in 50 million of its devices this year. Its existing AI tools allow touching up photos — such as removing window reflections. Oppo also has a ChatGPT-like bot. In addition to partnerships, Oppo said it has developed its own AI models since 2020 and opened an AI center in February. ""We are very optimistic about AI and have invested with great determination,"" Zhang said. ""AI is the most important area for tech in the future. All industries can be transformed by AI."" Counterpoint Research predicts shipments of generative AI smartphones will skyrocket to 732 million in 2028 from 46 million last year, according to a whitepaper published Wednesday. The report did not specify how complex those generative AI features would be. Apple next week is due to publicly release its first software update with AI tools. A subsequent update will allow removing unwanted elements in photos, and integration with ChatGPT, the iPhone maker said Wednesday. Chinese smartphone company Honor on Wednesday revealed the next version of its operating system that can use AI to mimic actions on a touchscreen, such as opening an app to order coffee delivery.

Oppo plans to integrate AI into its factories, which are increasingly automated, Zhang said. ""Today, automation improves quality and stability, lowers production costs and increases unit yield."" At a production line for an entry-level smartphone in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, Oppo has this year replaced about 8% of the workers with machines, and moved those employees to work on more complex, higher-end phones. Other companies have announced plans to integrate generative AI with the industrial sector. Honeywell this week announced a deal with Google's Gemini to create AI assistants for factory workers and systems. Oppo is rolling out its digital management system to its factories in seven other countries, starting with India and Indonesia. The company also produces phones in Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil and Egypt. ""Since our manufacturing process is largely digitalized and standardized, growing and expanding to global markets is much easier,"" Danny Du, director of manufacturing management at Oppo told CNBC. Oppo has cut its manufacturing costs by nearly 40% over three years, Du said, adding that technological integration with factory machines and systems has cut production time to six days, from 16. He said that allows Oppo to respond more quickly to market orders, instead of relying on longer-term forecasts that come with the risk of unsold inventory. — CNBC's Kif Leswing and Eric Rosenbaum contributed to this report. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that 60% of Oppo's shipments come from outside China. The piece also clarifies the scope of Microsoft features.",MSFT,yes,fmp,972
2024-10-24 08:01:49,CCP-linked antisemitic trolls are targeting down ballot Republicans in election influence operation: Microsoft,https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/ccp-linked-antisemitic-trolls-targeting-down-ballot-republicans-election-influence-operation-microsoft,"Chinese communists are attempting to influence U.S. elections with an online spambot campaign that targets Republican lawmakers who have denounced the People's Republic of China, according to Microsoft.

The latest Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) report details how fake social media accounts operated by a CCP-linked entity have attempted to influence voters in Alabama, Texas and Tennessee with a series of antisemitic posts denigrating Reps. Barry Moore, R-Ala.; Michael McCaul, R-Texas; and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. Experts say the influence operation has also targeted Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is not up for re-election until 2028.

The spambots have ""parroted antisemitic messages, amplified accusations of corruption and promoted opposition candidates,"" according to Microsoft.

Microsoft identified the group responsible as Taizi Flood, aka ""Spamouflage,"" which has previously been linked to China's Ministry of Public Security, researchers said.

A spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, D.C., told Reuters that China ""has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election"" and that such claims are ""full of malicious speculations.""

Microsoft said that at least one Taizi Flood bot targeted Moore over his support for Israel. ""The Taizi Flood posts about Moore frequently used antisemitic language. The posts received engagement from legitimate online users and were further amplified by other Taizi Flood assets online,"" the report said.

CHINA EXPERT SOUNDS ALARM OVER ‘WAR SIGNALS’: ‘XI JINPING IS ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING TRULY HORRENDOUS'

""At the same time, roughly two dozen Taizi Flood accounts posted various narratives accusing Senator Marco Rubio of corruption and connecting Rubio to criticisms made about the Harris-Walz campaign. MTAC has observed Chinese influence operations targeting Senator Rubio intermittently since the lead up to the 2022 midterm elections.""

Representatives for Rubio did not immediately respond to FOX Business' request for comment.

Blackburn indicated in a statement that she believes China was retaliating against her for her opposition to TikTok, a popular short-form video social media application.

""As long as I am going after their number one surveillance weapon — TikTok, holding them accountable for the damage they are doing to our children, working to keep them from buying up our farmland, and prohibiting them from spying on our citizens, I am their worst enemy. The CCP will continue to try to carry out their malign attacks against me but nothing will deter me from the mission: breaking China."" said Blackburn.

US COMPANIES WITH HIGH CHINA EXPOSURE FACE MORE RISKS

Microsoft said the bots began targeting Blackburn in September by amplifying claims from her Democratic opponent that she took money from pharmaceutical companies. They also accused McCaul of engaging in insider trading.

Though the Microsoft report found the spam posts did not result ""in high levels of engagement,"" lawmakers said they were aware of the campaign and criticized the antisemitism of the CCP.

""We know that the CCP is antisemitic, so it isn’t surprising that they are targeting me and other politicians who support Israel to try to sow division in advance of the most important election in our lifetime,"" Moore told Reuters.

""China has made it clear they will use every weapon in their arsenal, including offensive cyber capabilities, to try and destroy democracy across the world,"" he added.

In comments to Reuters, McCaul said he considered the targeting a ""badge of honor"" as he's made ""standing up to the CCP a central part of my career.""

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which is coordinating the federal effort to defend the election from foreign influence, referred Reuters to a past statement.

""Foreign actors — particularly Russia, Iran, and China — remain intent on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans’ confidence in the U.S. democratic system,"" it said.",MSFT,yes,fmp,807
2024-10-24 08:00:00,Ebb Carbon Signs Deal With Microsoft for CO2 Removal,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241024346899/en/Ebb-Carbon-Signs-Deal-With-Microsoft-for-CO2-Removal/,"SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ebb Carbon has signed an agreement with Microsoft to remove up to 350,000 tonnes of CO over the next 10 years using Ebb Carbon’s Electrochemical Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) – a method that increases the ocean’s natural ability to draw down and permanently store atmospheric CO . The agreement calls for Ebb Carbon to deliver an initial 1,333 tons of removals with options to purchase an additional 350,000 tonnes potentially available over 10 years.

To measure, report, and verify CO removed with its technology, Ebb will utilize Isometric’s recently-announced OAE protocol – the first such protocol published by a carbon registry for this promising removal pathway. Isometric’s protocol will ensure that Ebb Carbon’s credit deliveries to Microsoft meet the highest standards of scientific rigor and transparency.

“Microsoft is setting a powerful example with its commitment to becoming carbon negative by 2030 and by using its purchasing power to accelerate the most promising climate solutions. This agreement underscores the potential of Ebb Carbon’s technology to contribute meaningfully to gigaton-scale carbon removal in the years ahead,” said Ben Tarbell, CEO of Ebb Carbon

“The ocean is a critical part of the carbon cycle,” said Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy & Carbon Removal at Microsoft. “Ebb has developed technology to leverage the natural attributes of the ocean – its massive surface area and natural ocean processes that already pull CO from the atmosphere – to durably remove and store large volumes of atmospheric carbon. We are pleased to collaborate with Ebb to both accelerate the scientific foundation for ocean-based carbon dioxide removal and explore the potential of ocean-based carbon removal solutions at scale.”

“It's great to see Microsoft and Ebb using Isometric's first of its kind Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) protocol to verify carbon removal,” said Stacy Kauk, P.Eng., Chief Science Officer, Isometric. “OAE is promising because of the vast surface area of the ocean. This same fact requires careful monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV). Isometric's protocol requires measurements and the use of internationally recognized ocean models to quantify carbon removal so buyers and suppliers can be sure one credit equals one tonne of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere. This is another step towards creating trust and transparency in carbon markets.”

OAE leverages a natural process that occurs over geologic timescales as alkalinity is produced through the slow weathering of rocks. These alkaline minerals flow into the ocean where they convert CO in seawater into bicarbonate and carbonate ions that securely store carbon for more than 10,000 years. The resulting CO deficit is quickly rebalanced as surface waters in the ocean draw down additional CO from the atmosphere.

Ebb Carbon’s electrochemical OAE process uses bipolar electrodialysis (BPED) technology to separate seawater into acidic and alkaline streams. The alkaline stream is then returned to the ocean, where it mimics natural alkalization, converting CO in seawater into bicarbonate ions and enabling the ocean to absorb additional CO from the atmosphere. This process not only removes atmospheric carbon but also helps counter rising ocean acidification, a damaging effect of climate change that threatens marine life and coastal ecosystems. Selected for its low energy intensity and low capital costs, BPED is a mature and well-developed technology deployed at scale in industries such as winemaking and wastewater treatment.

The ocean has absorbed around 30 percent of all carbon dioxide emitted since the industrial revolution. Ebb is leveraging the natural attributes that make the ocean the world’s largest carbon sink in an attempt to store vast quantities of carbon.

Founded in 2020, Ebb has quickly established itself as a leading marine carbon dioxide (mCDR) provider. The company raised a $22 million Series A last year and is operating a pilot facility in partnership with the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Sequim, Washington. The company is also a semi finalist for DOE’s carbon removal purchase prize and a finalist for the XPrize.",MSFT,yes,fmp,839

2024-10-24 06:27:00,"The Race to a $4 Trillion Market Cap: Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/24/4-trillion-market-cap-apple-nvidia-microsoft/,"These three tech giants all have clear paths to the next market cap milestone, but one looks like a great bargain.

Apple (AAPL 0.36%) became the first company to top a $1 trillion market cap in 2018. Today, it remains the largest company in the world by market cap, sitting around $3.6 trillion. But it has some company near the top of the mountain.

Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%) has seen its value soar higher amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Its GPUs are essential infrastructure for companies training and running large language models. Its market cap currently sits just above $3.5 trillion as of this writing.

Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) managed to continue growing thanks to an early bet on generative AI leader OpenAI, which put its cloud computing business in an enviable position as developers and enterprises looked to take advantage of new AI capabilities. Its market cap sits at $3.1 trillion.

Because market prognosticators have a propensity for always searching out the next marker to hit, investors are likely seeing discussions about which of these companies could reach $4 trillion first (and stay there). Let's take a closer look at all three and see if an answer presents itself.

Apple took the wraps off its AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Unfortunately, all of those AI features weren't ready to go when the iPhone 16 launched in September. iPhone owners will get their first taste of Apple Intelligence at the end of October with more features coming out over the next six months or so.

Apple Intelligence includes some compelling promises that could make the iPhone a much more powerful device for productivity, communication, creativity, and general life management. But there's a big catch. It's only available on newer iPhones: the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the complete iPhone 16 lineup. As such, hundreds of millions of iPhone owners will have to upgrade their devices to get access to Apple Intelligence.

The interest in AI could lead to a so-called ""super cycle,"" driving record sales of the iPhone. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives thinks Apple could sell 240 million iPhones in fiscal 2025. Apple's already seeing relative strength in China compared to last year, and the early data from the U.S. launch were mostly positive. But it's likely to play out over the course of the year, if not longer.

A stronger-than-expected upgrade cycle and progress toward direct monetization of AI features could propel Apple's stock to the $4 trillion level. At its current price of 31.5 times analysts' consensus estimate for 2025 earnings, the stock trades at a premium to the overall market. Apple certainly deserves a premium given its massive free cash flow generation and share repurchase program. But Apple likely needs to outperform single-digit percentage revenue growth expectations for next year to justify a $4 trillion valuation.

No company has benefited more from the outsized interest in AI than Nvidia. Big tech companies are buying up Nvidia's high-end GPUs as fast as they can package them, and it doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon. CEO Jensen Huang recently said demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips is ""insane.""

That's supported by strong recent earnings results from its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.78%). TSMC expects fourth-quarter revenue to climb 35% year over year with expanding profit margins due to higher utilization of its more advanced processes. Those processes are used by Nvidia, among others, to make cutting-edge chips. TSMC also expects to spend more on capital expenditures in 2025, indicating it sees strong demand growth continuing into next year.

Nvidia's revenue is heavily reliant on just a few big companies. And those companies will be under pressure to show positive returns on their massive investments in AI data centers, including Nvidia's chips. As it stands, though, Nvidia's chips remain the best option for most of the big tech companies competing in the AI space. They simply can't afford to not buy the GPUs, as it could result in falling behind the competition.

Nvidia's current share price is about 35 times analysts' consensus expectations for next year's earnings. That's a big premium to the market, but analysts' true expectations appear to be even higher than what's printed. (After all, Nvidia's stock price has dropped in the past after the company beat expectations and provided a strong outlook.) As such, Nvidia's true multiple may be lower relative to true expectations, but it also means it must outperform significantly in order to reach the $4 trillion level.

Microsoft's early investment in OpenAI established it as a leader in artificial intelligence. Specifically, developers looking to make use of foundation models, including OpenAI's GPT, were drawn to Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure, and its capabilities.

Azure has been a growth story for Microsoft for a long time, but its growth is accelerating amid the AI boom, despite its already massive size. Azure revenue grew 29% year over year in the company's fourth quarter, faster than any of the competing public cloud providers.

Importantly, that growth looks like it will continue. Management says it expects Azure's revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the current fiscal year as it brings its capital investments of the last few quarters online. Microsoft spent $44.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2024, up 58% from the year before.

Microsoft is also integrating AI capabilities into its market-leading enterprise software, including Office 365. Its Copilot software is growing quickly, with total customers across all of its platforms increasing 60% sequentially in the fourth quarter. There's a lot of room left to grow, too, as Microsoft counted over 400 million Office 365 seats at the end of last year, and it continues to grow at a high single-digit-percentage rate every quarter.

Microsoft stock currently trades for about 32 times analysts' consensus 2025 earnings estimate, but it arguably deserves an even higher multiple as it represents the best way to play both sides of the AI coin: infrastructure and software. Its massive free cash flow from enterprise software supports reinvestment in Azure and a healthy buyback. Margins should improve over time, too, as both Azure and Copilot scale, which combined with healthy revenue growth and share buybacks should result in substantial earnings growth. Microsoft looks most likely among the three tech giants to outperform expectations, which will push it much closer to the $4 trillion milestone.

Who will win the race?

Microsoft looks most attractively priced in today's market, but it's also the furthest away from $4 trillion at this point. With a market cap of $3.1 trillion, the stock would have to climb about 29% to reach the milestone. While Microsoft's price multiple (or earnings estimates) may expand over the next few quarters as the market recognizes the attractive price, it might not be the first to $4 trillion. Still, I'd argue it's the best of the three to buy right now.

As for who reaches $4 trillion first, Nvidia and Apple are neck and neck. Either company could hit $4 trillion in just a few months if the market cooperates and they provide good earnings data or outlooks.

Apple is the safer bet to get there eventually, but Nvidia could certainly beat it to the punch if big tech reports positive earnings results with bigger-than-expected capital expenditure budgets for 2025. Nvidia could just as easily see its stock price fall considerably lower with just one bad data point in its earnings. That makes it a much riskier bet to reach and stay above the $4 trillion milestone.",MSFT,yes,fmp,1571

- Preliminary results of product development automation and statistical analysis of syndromic test results powered with Microsoft's AI technology were showcased

- Companies fostered collaboration to drive collective impact towards next year's 'a world free from diseases' declaration ceremony

SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Seegene Inc., a leading South Korean company providing a total solution for PCR molecular diagnostics, held the first executive roundtable with Microsoft and Springer Nature to discuss advancing its technology-sharing initiative aimed at mitigating future pandemics and creating 'a world free from diseases', including the showcase of preliminary results from an automated diagnostic development system powered with Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This is the first official event that the three companies gathered to discuss the initiative.

On October 23, the three companies convened at Springer Nature London Campus Auditorium for the technology-sharing initiative partner roundtable to share initial achievements and explore strategies for further collaboration. Dr. Jong-Yoon Chun, CEO and founder of Seegene; Marc Spenlé, chief operating officer of Springer Nature; Steven Inchcoombe, president of research at Springer Nature; and Elena Bonfiglioli, vice president of global business leader healthcare, pharma and life science at Microsoft attended the meeting.

""By integrating Seegene's proprietary syndromic real-time PCR technology, Microsoft's cutting-edge AI and cloud services, and Springer Nature's extensive reach in the global scientific community, we will create new avenues for collaboration with scientists and experts in this technology-sharing initiative,"" said Dr. Chun, CEO and founder of Seegene.

The technology-sharing initiative aims to globally share Seegene's advanced diagnostic and data analysis technologies, including syndromic real-time PCR and an automated product development system (SGDDS), with a leading company partnered in each country. Partnering companies will collaborate with local scientists and experts to develop diagnostic tests tailored to the needs of their communities and fields, spanning a wide range of human and non-human diseases. Amidst the challenges of climate change and the anticipated rise in outbreaks, the initiative's ultimate vision is to create 'a world free from diseases'—a future where people no longer suffer from infectious diseases and cancer, and where animals and plants thrive without illness.

Seegene's syndromic real-time PCR technology represents a breakthrough in molecular target detection, unparalleled by other PCR methods. It enables the simultaneous detection of up to 14 pathogens in a single reaction tube, with quantitative information for each target. Furthermore, multi-tube panel tests may be designed to cover an even more comprehensive set of pathogens with overlapping symptoms. As a powerful tool for mitigating the growing threat of multi-pandemics—exacerbated by climate change—Seegene's technology enhances the ability to monitor and respond to a diverse range of rapidly evolving pathogens.

Companies participating in the technology-sharing initiative will gain access to Seegene's cutting-edge technology and expertise, enabling them to develop and manufacture syndromic real-time PCR products tailored to their countries' specific public health needs. Localization of such capabilities through this initiative will allow their communities to promptly respond to future outbreaks and multi-pathogen pandemics.

Building on the momentum achieved during this year's roundtable, a declaration ceremony is expected to take place in the second half of next year, where strategies to maximize synergy amongst the three company's technology will be further discussed.

At the meeting in London, Seegene and Microsoft showcased the preliminary results of integrating Microsoft's Azure Open AI into the research planning module of Seegene's automated product development system (SGDDS). The use of AI technology dramatically reduced the time needed to process and analyze relevant information from published scientific literature. Additionally, the two companies demonstrated a proof of concept for Seegene's syndromic-based statistical analysis system that leverages Fabric, Microsoft's AI-driven data integration platform, ultimately to discover statistical correlations between multiple pathogens causing similar symptoms, support accurate diagnosis and treatment, and predict future outbreaks.

""Until now, scientists and experts have been confined to limited local data, usually generated by themselves. However, access to diagnostic information shared across the world powered with Microsoft's AI technology will enable swift response to any emerging diseases,"" said Dr. Chun at Seegene.

""Seegene and Microsoft shared the vision of a new generation of diagnostic solutions, accessible at population level to help people stay healthier longer. Cloud and AI solutions help protect, manage and reason over the vast amounts of data needed to track diagnosis of global diseases in real time. Microsoft is the trusted partner to help realize Seegene's vision of building 'a world free from diseases,'"" said Ms. Bonfiglioli from Microsoft.

In January 2024, Seegene and Microsoft entered a strategic collaboration to integrate Microsoft's Azure Open AI services into numerous modules of Seegene's SGDDS. The goal of these collaborative projects is to empower global companies participating in the technology-sharing initiative with a streamlined product development system augmented by advanced IT system operations and AI-powered data analysis.

Springer Nature was also present at the discussion. Since 2023, Seegene and Springer Nature have been running the Open Innovation Program (OIP) that invited scientists and experts around the world to participate in the development of clinically significant diagnostics assays. This year, the program was renewed by Springer Nature as the prestigious Nature Awards, MDx Impact Grants, calling for innovative proposals for PCR diagnostic assay development. Springer Nature will oversee key aspects of the process, including project submissions and evaluations, expecting to broaden interest and participation from the global scientific community.

In May 2024, the two companies signed a strategic alliance agreement that included expansion of the OIP program scope. Springer Nature will encourage the global scientific community to participate in the ideation, design, and development of new PCR diagnostic products.

""We have high expectations that the MDx Impact Grants will work synergistically with the technology-sharing initiative serving as a catalyst for greater adoption of PCR molecular diagnostics. Together we will build an ecosystem that promotes the development of accurate, rapid, accessible tests for underserved patient populations."" said Mr. Spenlé, the COO of Springer Nature.

An OIP Award ceremony was held, following the technology-sharing initiative partner roundtable to recognize the European winners. At the ceremony, eight scientists working in Europe among 17 awardees across the world were honored for their achievements. The awardees were as follows: Ulrich Eigner (Germany); Gian Maria Rossolini (Italy); Vismara Chiara Silvia (Italy); Davy Vanden Broeck (Belgium); Nicolas Yin (Belgium); Piet Cools (Belgium); Khoa Thai (Netherlands); Pedro Vieira-Baptista (Portugal).

Prof. Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), attended the event as a keynote speaker. During her visit to South Korea in March this year, Prof. Harries met with Dr. Chun at Seegene's headquarters to discuss Seegene's response and achievements during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to exchange views on its technology-sharing initiatives and the Open Innovation Program (OIP).

Companies participating in the technology-sharing initiative, such as Hy Laboratories Ltd. based in Israel and Werfen based in Spain, along with other business partners and bio-medical experts from Europe, attended the event to share the vision of the technology-sharing initiative.

Seegene has 24 years of dedicated experience in R&D, manufacturing, and business related to syndromic real-time PCR technologies. This expertise was particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic when Seegene provided over 340 million COVID-19 tests to more than 100 countries worldwide. The core feature of Seegene's syndromic real-time PCR technology is the ability to simultaneously test for 14 pathogens that cause similar symptoms in a single tube with quantitative information.",MSFT,yes,fmp,1632

2024-10-23 12:04:42,Citi lowers Microsoft (MSFT) stock price target ahead of earnings,https://finbold.com/citi-lowers-microsoft-msft-stock-price-target-ahead-of-earnings/,"As Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) approaches its fiscal first-quarter earnings report, Citigroup has revised its twelve-month price target for the tech giant, lowering it from $500 to $497.

Despite the lower target, Citigroup maintains a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock. The revision reflects concerns over rising capital expenditures and slower growth in Microsoft’s cloud computing division, Azure, which has underperformed expectations in recent quarters.

Currently, Microsoft stock is trading at $428.93, showing a 1.5% rise over the past five days and a modest 1% gain over the past month.

Microsoft’s market performance has been relatively tepid compared to the broader tech sector. Since late April, Microsoft’s stock has risen by only about 5%, significantly lagging behind the Nasdaq’s 18% gain during the same period.

One major factor contributing to this slower growth is the company’s increasing capital expenditures, which are projected to rise by 36% year-on-year to $55.7 billion in 2024.

For instance, in the fourth quarter of FY2024, which ended in June, Microsoft’s capital expenditures reached $19 billion, with nearly all of it allocated to artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-related spending.

This investment is focused on building and leasing data centers, which the company expects to monetize over the next 15 years, as well as acquiring servers (CPUs and GPUs) to meet the increasing demand for AI and cloud services.

As AI drives higher energy consumption, Microsoft has also taken steps to secure reliable energy sources, such as its September deal to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania.

While these investments position Microsoft for future growth, concerns remain about their short-term impact on profitability. Citigroup analyst Tyler Radke expressed reservations about Microsoft’s heavy spending on AI initiatives, noting that these investments have yet to generate the expected returns.

Radke also highlighted that Microsoft’s earnings could face headwinds in the near term due to the capital expenditure surge and Azure’s underperformance.

Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing division, has historically been a key growth driver. However, recent performance has fallen short of expectations, with internal capacity constraints and broader economic challenges slowing its growth.

This underperformance was particularly noticeable in Microsoft’s fiscal fourth quarter, which gave mixed results.

Meanwhile, investors are also closely monitoring other segments, such as Dynamics 365 and the Power Platform. Notably, Dynamics 365, Microsoft’s CRM and ERP solution, posted a 19% revenue increase in the previous quarter, boosting overall Dynamics revenue by 16%.

The Power Platform, which includes tools like Power BI, Power Apps, and Power Automate, also experienced substantial growth, with over 48 million monthly active users and a 40% increase year-on-year.

Despite Citigroup’s lowered price target, Microsoft continues to receive strong support from Wall Street analysts. For instance, Loop Capital’s Yun Kim reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating with a $500 price target ahead of Microsoft’s Q1 results.

Kim expects a “solid” quarter, with key growth drivers showing modest acceleration. The firm also notes that recent industry checks indicate a slight improvement in IT spending, which could support further growth into the end of 2024.

In summary, Citigroup’s decision to lower Microsoft’s price target ahead of earnings highlights growing concerns over capital expenditure and Azure’s slower-than-expected growth.

However, despite these short-term challenges, analysts remain bullish on Microsoft’s long-term potential, particularly as the company continues to integrate AI across its product offerings and expand its cloud services.",MSFT,yes,fmp,722

Nuclear power may be making a comeback in the U.S. after years of setbacks — and big tech is the driving force.

As tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon and Google compete to take the lead in the AI revolution, the data centers needed to power the burgeoning technology consume an ever-increasing amount of energy.

In the last two months, those three companies have penned deals to generate more nuclear power — perhaps most notably, Microsoft struck a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the most serious nuclear meltdown in U.S. history in 1979. The reopening is planned for 2028.

Speaking to CNBC at the annual International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington, long-time energy market veteran Dan Yergin described the turnaround as nothing short of extraordinary.

""It's amazing, the change. The nuclear industry was in the doldrums,"" Yergin told CNBC's Karen Tso on Tuesday, describing the reopening of the Three Mile Island power plant as ""symbolic.""

""Big Tech is saying, 'We need reliable 24 hour electricity. We can't get it just from wind and solar',"" he said.

Yergin, who has written several books on energy including ""The Prize"" and ""The New Map,"" pointed to the booming funding going into the sector. He cited $7 billion in venture capital going into nuclear fusion alone — which does not include financing for nuclear fission, a different energy-generating process.

""This is a really big change, and it reflects in this country, in the United States, a sense that — we've had for, really, a generation of flat demand [for] electricity,"" Yergin said. ""Now it's going to grow, and there's real anxiety about, how do you grow it? And nuclear [energy] is back in form, and people are talking about small nuclear reactors. And, of course, you have big tech actually seeking to contract for the output of the electricity from existing nuclear power plants. It's an amazing change.""",MSFT,yes,fmp,461

Anthropic is the company behind Claude — one of the chatbots that, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, has exploded in popularity. Startups like Anthropic, alongside tech giants such as Google , Amazon , Microsoft and Meta, are all part of a generative AI arms race to ensure they don't fall behind in a market predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.

Anthropic's new Computer Use capability, part of its two newest AI models, allows its tech to interpret what's on a computer screen, select buttons, enter text, navigate websites and execute tasks through any software and real-time internet browsing.

The tool can ""use computers in basically the same way that we do,"" Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview, adding it can do tasks with ""tens or even hundreds of steps.""

Amazon had early access to the tool, Anthropic told CNBC, and early customers and beta testers included Asana, Canva and Notion. The company has been working on the tool since early this year, according to Kaplan.

Anthropic released the feature Tuesday in public beta for developers. The team hopes to open up use to consumers and enterprise clients over the next few months, or early next year, per Kaplan.

Anthropic said that future consumer applications include booking flights, scheduling appointments, filling out forms, conducting online research and filing expense reports.

The fellowship will also provide OpenAI and Microsoft Azure credits to help these publications experiment and develop tools to assist with local news. As part of the program, the news organizations will work collaboratively with each other and the broader news industry to share learnings, product developments, case studies and technical information needed to help replicate their work in other newsrooms. An additional three organizations will be awarded fellows in a second round of grants.

""We are pleased to be working with both OpenAI and Microsoft on this important initiative to support local news,"" said Jim Friedlich, executive director and CEO of The Lenfest Institute. ""Through these fellowships — and by sharing results with the broader news industry — we will help empower local newsrooms to explore, implement and advocate for AI business solutions that uphold the highest ethical standards while strengthening their future prospects. The Lenfest Institute and OpenAI incubated the fellowship program, which is designed to promote the use of AI in creating a sustainable future for independent local journalism, and we welcome its expansion in scope and resources with Microsoft's commitment.""

The first slate of AI Collaborative and Fellows members will work on projects that focus on the use of AI for analysis of public data, to better utilize news and visual archives, to build audience engagement, for creating new AI-based news tools and products, and more. The projects were chosen through an application process led by The Lenfest Institute with assistance from FT Strategies, a global media consultant, and Nota, a provider of AI tools for journalism.

""While nothing will replace the central role of reporters, we believe that AI technology can help in the research, investigation, distribution and monetization of important journalism. We're deeply invested in supporting smaller, independent publishers through initiatives like The Lenfest Institute AI Collaborative and Fellowship, ensuring they have access to the same cutting-edge tools and opportunities as larger organizations,"" said Tom Rubin, chief of Intellectual Property and Content, OpenAI. ""Local news is a particularly vulnerable area of journalism, and we believe AI can help it thrive.""
• Chicago Public Media, which publishes The Chicago Sun-Times and runs public radio station WBEZ, will focus on leveraging AI for transcription, summarization and translation to expand content offerings and reach new audiences.
• The Minnesota Star Tribune will experiment with AI summarization, analysis and content discovery for both its journalists and readers.
• Newsday will build AI public data summarization and aggregation tools for its newsroom, for readers and for businesses as a marketing services offering.

2024-10-22 08:17:00,"If I Could Buy Only 3 Dow Jones Stocks Through 2025, I'd Pick These 3 Dividend-Growth Companies",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/22/buy-dow-jones-stock-2025-dividend-growth/,"Microsoft, Nike, and Disney offer investors a blend of value, growth, and income.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been around since the late 19th century. Its storied past has made it one of the key benchmarks that investors turn to for gauging stock market performance.

The 30 components in the Dow have changed a lot in recent years, with the addition of Amazon, Salesforce, and other growth names. Still, the Dow acts as a great representative of the broader market. And with all but two components paying dividends (Amazon and Boeing), the Dow is a great starting point for discovering blue chip dividend stocks.

Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) and Walt Disney (DIS -0.39%) have been components of the Dow since the 1990s, while Nike (NKE -0.24%) was added in 2013. Here's why all three Dow stocks are balanced buys worth considering through 2025.

Microsoft will report its fiscal 2025's first-quarter earnings on Oct. 30. Investors will likely be watching for sustained growth in its Intelligent Cloud, artificial intelligence (AI) product improvements, engagement with Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot, guidance for fiscal 2025, and the company's capital expenditure (capex) plans.

The company has been growing capex faster than revenue as it ramps up AI spending -- and there are concerns that spending may not pay off as much as investors hope, which could pressure the stock price. But management has lots of advantages over smaller companies. For starters, it has more cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities than debt on its balance sheet. Strong financial health gives Microsoft the wiggle room to pounce on exciting opportunities.

Microsoft also generates so much profit that it can afford these aggressive spending plans and still have plenty of cash left over to buy back a ton of its own stock and pay a rapidly growing dividend. In September, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.83 per share and authorized a new $60 billion share repurchase program.

Over the past decade, the company has increased its dividend by 168% and reduced its share count by nearly 10% -- which is impressive considering its high stock-based compensation expense.

Microsoft is a balanced tech stock with a multi-decade runway for continued growth, helping to justify its current price-to-earnings ratio of 35.4. It's a top Dow stock to watch through 2025 and could be an incredibly compelling buy if Wall Street beats its stock price down over short-term concerns.

Nike has a lot of work to do

There's no sugarcoating how bad Nike stock has been in 2024: down over 23% compared to big gains in the major indexes. It is within 20% of a five-year low and is bringing in a new CEO to turn the business around.

Like many companies, Nike is dealing with a slowdown in China. But what's particularly concerning is that lower sales and profitability have spread throughout the business, including footwear and apparel across all regions. Total Nike brand sales for the three months ended Aug. 31 were down 10% compared to the same period last year. And that same period in 2023 wasn't even that impressive of a quarter.

Nike's problems certainly aren't trivial, but they do seem solvable. And when top brands go on sale for challenges that can prove temporary, it's often a phenomenal time to buy the stock.

The main issues are that it mismanaged customer demand and was hit hard by supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. The build-out of Nike Direct, its e-commerce platform, was meant to help it be less dependent on wholesale and engage directly with consumers. But even Nike Direct is struggling, with sales down 13% in the recent quarter.

At just 23.9 times earnings and with a dividend yield of 1.8%, Nike stock stands out as a compelling value and a decent source of passive income in an otherwise expensive market. However, investors should only consider the stock if they are willing to give the company time to turn things around, as the situation could worsen before it gets better.

Disney is another Dow component that has been a major disappointment for patient investors. The stock is up less than 25% from its 10-year low and is on track to underperform the S&P 500 for the fourth consecutive year. But things are finally looking up for the media and entertainment giant.

Its streaming service, Disney+, is finally profitable. The company is back to generating box office hits, most notably Inside Out 2, which was a smashing success.

Management is paying a dividend and buying back stock again -- a sign it isn't as strapped for cash as it was a couple of years ago when Disney+ was bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars each quarter in operating losses.

Still, Disney is a highly cyclical company that depends on consumer discretionary spending. When household budgets get cut, a Disney trip is likely top of the list. After years of price increases, it just hiked theme park prices again, which could lead to disgruntled customers and hurt demand.

The company is not at the top of its game, but the worst of its box office blues and streaming slog are over. As with Nike, buying Disney now is more of a bet on where it could be years from now than where it is today. It stands out as a top value stock for patient investors to buy now.",MSFT,yes,fmp,1113
2024-10-22 08:00:16,3 Stocks Driving the Shift to Nuclear Energy for AI Power,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-driving-the-shift-to-nuclear-energy-for-ai-power/,"Processing artificial intelligence (AI) queries consumes 300% to 400% more electricity than normal searches. The need to power the AI revolution triggered a race to find and lock down alternative sustainable energy options for the major hyperscalers in the computer and technology sector. Nuclear energy as a clean energy source to power data centers made headlines after Microsoft Co. NASDAQ: MSFT signed the largest power purchase agreement ever with Constellation Energy Co. NASDAQ: CEG, which will require restarting a nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island. Other hyperscalers followed. Here’s how three major hyperscalers are turning to nuclear to power their AI data centers.

Microsoft made the proverbial shot heard around the world when it signed the largest power purchase agreement in history with Constellation Energy. Constellation Energy plans to revive the 835 MW Three Mile Island Unit 1 Nuclear Reactor pending approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Microsoft has agreed to buy electricity from the nuclear plant for its data centers in the Pennsylvania region. Constellation will invest $1.3 billion of its capital to kickstart the plant by 2028.

Microsoft has over 300 data centers spread out through more than 34 countries, which help provide the backbone for the Microsoft Cloud. Microsoft has committed to reducing the environmental impact of its data centers by sourcing sustainable clean energy sources and investing in sustainable innovations.

Amazon: Growing Its Nuclear Ambitions and Transition to Carbon-Free Energy

Amazon NASDAQ: (AMZN may have initially started the nuclear movement with its acquisition of the 1,200-acre Cumulus Data Assets data center from Talen Energy in March of 2024 for $650 million. The campus is located right next to Talen's nuclear energy plant, the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station in Salem Township, which happens to be the sixth-largest nuclear plant in the country. Talen will sell electricity directly to the data center in 120 MW increments up to 960 MW. Since they will be sourcing directly, Amazon will avoid paying $140 million in transmission fees.

This has caused competing utilities to try to stop the deal stating that the $140 million of costs would fall onto its customers and that Amazon is getting a free ride since they would still be benefitting from the transmission system. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is expected to rule on the precedent-setting co-location dispute as more cloud providers seek to co-locate their data centers with power plants.

Amazon announced it was investing in small modular reactor (SMR) technology with various companies. It's part of a bring your own power (BYOP) initiative to the buildout of data centers, which has state officials excited. SMRs are smaller nuclear reactors that can be built faster and closer to the grid since they have a smaller footprint. It also enables them to come online more quickly. SMRs can be scaled, meaning they can be built and deployed in increments as power needs grow. Utilities can add on capacity as needed and deploy multiple units on a single site.

This means less capital is required upfront. They can also be constructed in factories and then transported to sites. Amazon, along with various investors, made a $500 million investment in its Series C-1 financing round for X-energy, a developer of next-gen SMR reactors and fuel. X-energy's nuclear reactor design is expected to be used in the 320 MW Energy Northwest project. Amazon hopes to bring 5 GW of electricity online by 2039.

Amazon signed an agreement with Dominion Energy Inc. NYSE: D to explore developing an SMR project near its North Anna nuclear power plant to bring at least 300 MW of power to the Virginia region, which is expected to increase its power demand by 85% over the next 15 years. SMRs can provide around one-third of the power of a traditional nuclear reactor.

Google: Trying to Bring SMRs Online by 2030

Not to be outdone, Google NASDAQ: GOOG announced a new clean energy agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple SMRs developed by Kairos Power. Google expects the first SMR to come online by 2030, with more coming online through 2035, generating 500 MW for the grid. Kairos will have up to seven SMRs to supply 500 MW of electricity to its data centers.

ASML had a hiccup in its third-quarter 2024 earnings report. Bookings collapsed 53% YoY. This was mostly due to falling demand in non-AI and consumer electronics. AI demand remains robust. The company lowered its Q4 2024. Net bookings dropped 52.8% but rose 1.2% YoY in Q3 2024. However, the company expects strong sales growth to $37.45 billion in 2025, driven by AI demand. Google consumed 24 million MW of electricity in 2023 to power all its data centers and operations.

2024-10-22 07:15:00,"The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/22/the-best-stocks-to-invest-50000-in-right-now/,"These three fundamentally strong stocks can deliver impressive returns in the future.

In the past couple of years, artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as one of the key investment themes on Wall Street. The frenzy surrounding AI is not without reason -- it presents a set of technological tools and innovations that transform entire industries and functional disciplines. Wall Street had to jump on this bandwagon, and subsequently, many AI-powered stocks soared to dizzying highs.

Some of these stocks are still going strong and can generate impressive returns in the next few years, especially for investors with around $50,000 to spare now (which is not required for regular expenditures or contingencies).

Here's what I consider a hypothetical $50,000 investment portfolio should look like.

Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%) will account for the biggest chunk or 40% ($20,000) of my hypothetical $50,000 investment portfolio.

The company is the undisputed leader in the global AI market thanks to its focus on offering a complete end-to-end AI platform comprising technologically superior chips (graphics processing units or GPUs, data-center products, and DGX systems); software ecosystem (CUDA, a parallel computing platform); Nvidia AI Enterprise software and data-center specific accelerated-software solutions; advanced-networking components; and servers.

Nvidia's stock soared 2,900% in the past five years (after adjusting for the 10:1 stock split in June 2024). Yet, the company still has the potential to grow even higher in 2025 mainly driven by the surging demand for its next-generation Blackwell platform, which is far outpacing supply. Nvidia expects to ramp up production of Blackwell systems and record billions of dollars in Blackwell revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending Jan. 31, 2025). Reports also indicate that these Blackwell systems sold out for the next 12 months, implying the company will enjoy solid pricing power.

In the face of a tight Blackwell supply, Nvidia may continue to see robust demand for its Hopper chips from data center and enterprise AI segments in the coming quarters. Additionally, the company's software solutions are proving to be a major competitive edge, since they help boost the adoption and functioning of the company's hardware products. As the CUDA-compatible graphics processing unit (GPU)-installed base grows from millions to tens of millions in the AI market, Nvidia expects demand for Nvidia AI Enterprise software to grow significantly in the coming months. The company expects its software business to reach an annual run rate of $2 billion by the end of fiscal 2025, thus emerging as a major-revenue catalyst in the next few years.

Considering the many tailwinds, Nvidia has lots of upside potential.

Technology behemoth Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) will make up 30% or $15,000 of my hypothetical $50,000 investment portfolio.

Microsoft's partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI proved transformational and played a pivotal role in enabling the company to build AI-optimized hardware and software stacks rapidly. The demand for Microsoft's AI infrastructure, which includes Azure AI services (cloud-native suite of AI applications focused on areas such as data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning), CoPilots (AI agents integrated into various applications), and custom AI chips, has been far outpacing supply.

The increasing adoption of AI services is also driving the usage of Microsoft's data services. The number of Azure AI customers using the company's data services grew by almost 50% year over year in the fiscal 2024 Q4 (ending June 30, 2024). Microsoft Fabric, the company's AI-powered next-generation data platform, had more than 14,000 paying customers at the end of the fourth quarter. Microsoft's Azure Arc service, a multicloud and on-premise management solution, was also adopted by nearly 36,000 customers at the end of quarter, up 90% on a year-over-year basis.

Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business is also a major growth catalyst. Azure is a key beneficiary of the ongoing migration of on-premise enterprise data to the cloud. Furthermore, the company's cloud-based data-integration service, Data Factory, enables clients to connect their on-premise data estate to Azure services and Fabric services even before full-data migration.

Cybersecurity is another major growth avenue, with the company boasting a customer base of 1.2 million for its security offerings at the end of Q4. Over 800,000 large customers were using four or more of the company's security workloads, up 25% on a year-over-year basis. This implies that Microsoft's products are tightly integrated into many of their customers' operations, making it difficult for the latter to switch to competitors.

Clearly, Microsoft has several growth drivers that can have a very positive impact on its financial and share-price performance in fiscal 2025.

In summary, Microsoft may be a smart buy for astute investors.

Social media giant Meta Platforms (META 0.96%) will account for the remaining 30% or $15,000 of my hypothetical $50,000 investment portfolio.

Accounting for a 21.3% share of the U.S. digital-advertising spending, Meta demonstrated an exceptional ability to effectively monetize its Family of Apps (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger). This is evident based on the steady improvement in the cost per impression paid by advertisers for advertising on Facebook and Instagram since January 2024.

Meta leverages multiple AI technologies to improve content recommendations across its social media applications, which in turn helps add new users and boost overall user engagement. The company also helps advertisers create more targeted advertisement campaigns with its AI-powered Advantage+ suite of solutions. All these initiatives translate into higher returns for advertisers, which increase the attractiveness of Meta's social media applications.

Meta has nearly 3.2 billion people using at least one of its applications in the fiscal 2024 Q2 (ending June 30, 2024). The huge user base and broad geographical reach generated a powerful network effect since more users make the platform even more attractive for advertisers, who then offer additional avenues for user engagement. Subsequently, Meta enjoys significant pricing power for its digital assets. Furthermore, the user base gives the company access to more data, which helps it improve its content recommendation and ad-targeting algorithms.

Meta's Reality Labs business is not yet profitable. However, the company views it as a solid long-term investment. Plus, based on the strength of its core digital-advertising business, Meta seems to be a smart pick now.",MSFT,yes,fmp,1341
2024-10-22 07:10:00,"Got $1,000 to Invest? This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Is a Great Option Heading Into 2025",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/22/got-1000-to-invest-this-magnificent-seven-stock-is/,"The wide range of products and services Microsoft offers means its business faces fewer risks than other big tech companies.

The ""Magnificent Seven"" is a name given to a group of the world's largest and most promising tech companies. Its members are Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%), Apple (AAPL 0.36%), Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%), Alphabet (GOOG 1.50%) (GOOGL 1.57%), Amazon (AMZN 0.78%), Meta (META 0.96%), and Tesla (TSLA 3.34%). Of those, Tesla is the smallest, with a market cap of about $700 billion. Needless to say, these are powerhouse companies.

There are great cases for investing in all of the Magnificent Seven companies, but Microsoft is the one I'm most excited about now. If you have $1,000 to invest (meaning you already have an emergency fund set aside and your high-interest debt is paid down), it could become a staple of your portfolio.

I like Microsoft going into 2025 because its business is much more diversified than the other Magnificent Seven companies. Its success -- or lack thereof -- won't rely on a specific product or service. For perspective, here are products or services that will determine a lot about how the other Magnificent Seven stocks fare:
• Apple: As the iPhone goes, so does Apple. When iPhone sales are great, Apple's revenue growth is great; when they're down, it weighs heavily on Apple's revenue.
• Nvidia: Nvidia's success will be tied to the sales of its graphic processing units, which have become vital to the artificial intelligence pipeline.
• Alphabet: Advertising on Google Search is the backbone of Alphabet. Any slowdowns or disruptions to the advertising business will have tangible effects on its bottom line.
• Amazon: E-commerce is Amazon's bread and butter. Amazon Web Services brings in the most profit, but e-commerce generates the revenue Amazon relies on to fund its other ventures.
• Meta: Advertising provided more than 98% of Meta's revenue in its latest quarter. Any slowdown in the digital ad business will stall the company's financial growth.
• Tesla: If Tesla can't scale its electric vehicle production and hold onto its lead in the industry, the company faces a major uphill battle.

This isn't a knock on any of the above businesses. I'm a strong believer in most of them. More than anything, it highlights how wide Microsoft has cast its business web.

Microsoft has enterprise software, consumer software, cloud services, gaming, social media, and hardware products, and it's not overly dependent on any of them. Its largest business segment, Intelligent Cloud, only accounts for about 44% of its revenue.

You can't argue against Microsoft's financials

Microsoft's strong financial performance in recent years is undeniable. In its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), its revenue and operating income both increased 15% year over year to $64.7 billion and $27.9 billion, respectively.

It has also doubled its operating income (profit from core operations) during the past five years -- a great feat for a company of its size. It's a testament to its operational efficiency and growth of high-margin businesses like its cloud platform, Azure.

Cloud computing will continue to be a high-growth area for Microsoft in the near future. Even if it doesn't grow at the pace it has during the past few years (although it should), it will still provide a nice boost to Microsoft's financials.

It's not cheap, but it's worth it for long-term investors

Admittedly, Microsoft is priced at a premium, though that has been the case for a while. The shares trade at about 31.6 times forward earnings, significantly higher than the S&P 500's average of 22.8. But rarely do world-class companies with as much attention as Microsoft trade at a bargain level, so it's not too surprising.

Anytime you invest in a stock that's priced at a premium, you run the risk of limiting your near-term upside potential. Luckily, Microsoft has committed to returning shareholder value via dividends and stock buybacks.

Its $0.83 quarterly dividend gives it a yield of about 0.8% at the recent share price, but Microsoft has consistently increased its payouts through the years. Investors will also appreciate Microsoft's recently announced $60 billion stock buyback program.

If you're looking for an undervalued company or a true income stock, Microsoft likely won't be your go-to pick. However, if you're in it for the long haul, Microsoft is a stock you could feel comfortable buying and holding on to without too much concern about its current valuation.",MSFT,yes,fmp,966
2024-10-21 20:00:00,Better AI Stock: Microsoft vs. Lumen Technologies,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/21/better-ai-stock-microsoft-vs-lumen-technologies/,"Which of these AI-oriented tech stocks is a better buy today?

In the past, Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) and Lumen (LUMN 2.55%), the telecom company formerly known as CenturyLink, weren't often mentioned in the same breath. Microsoft was a rapidly growing tech giant with plenty of irons in the fire across the cloud, mobile, AI, and gaming markets. But Lumen was a struggling telecom company which had doubled down on the dying business wireline market instead of building higher-growth wireless networks.

By this June, Lumen's stock had dipped below $1. That was more than 95% below its all-time high from 2014. But in July, Lumen drove away the bears by securing a new networking and fiber deal with Microsoft's Azure, the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform. The market's enthusiasm for that deal propelled Lumen's stock back to $6.

So in an odd twist, investors who bought Lumen's stock when it slumped to $1 actually outperformed Microsoft's investors over the past four months. But can Lumen keep generating bigger gains than Microsoft for the foreseeable future?

Lumen's revenue has declined for five consecutive years. It's also been unprofitable over the past two years, and it suspended its dividend in 2022. That meltdown was mainly caused by the decline of its wireline business, which offset the stronger growth of its fiber business and its ancillary sales of cloud, security, and collaboration services.

However, Lumen's focus on business wireline connections actually made it an ideal partner for Microsoft, which needed to rapidly expand its data center infrastructure to support its growing ecosystem of cloud, mobile, and AI applications. Therefore, those growth engines within Microsoft could generate strong long-term tailwinds for Lumen's wireline business.

Before Microsoft swooped in, Lumen was in serious trouble. It ended 2023 with a negative free cash flow (FCF) of $878 million, and it was still shouldering $18.4 billion in long-term debt in its latest quarter with a whopping debt-to-equity ratio of 70. For 2024, analysts expect its revenue to decline 11% to $13 billion with a net loss of $252 million.

But in early August, Lumen said it had secured $5 billion in new business (including Microsoft's Azure deal) related to the AI connectivity market. It also said it was in ""active discussions"" to ""secure another $7 billion in sales opportunities"" and would aim to ""more than double its intercity network miles over the next five years."" It expects the initial payments from those contracts to boost its annual FCF to positive $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2024.

Lumen's statement suggests it could potentially generate $5 billion to $12 billion in revenues over the next five years ($1 billion to $2.4 billion annually) from its new AI-related contracts. That would equal about 7% to 16% of its estimated revenue in 2023, but we don't know if those tailwinds can offset the ongoing decline of its non-AI business wireline division.

Analysts still expect Lumen's revenue to decline in 2025 and 2026 -- so they don't seem convinced its new AI contracts will fix its business. But with an enterprise value of $23 billion, Lumen's stock looks cheap at less than 2 times this year's sales.

But it probably won't stay ahead of Microsoft over the long term

Lumen outperformed Microsoft in recent months, but that was mainly because the Azure deal brought its stock back from the brink of a delisting. It could be tough for Lumen to maintain that momentum if its new AI deals don't move the needle.

As for Microsoft, the tech giant is still firing on all cylinders as it prioritizes the expansion of its cloud, mobile, and AI ecosystems. Under Satya Nadella, who took the helm as its CEO in 2014, Microsoft transformed its productivity software into sticky cloud-based services, expanded Azure's cloud infrastructure platform, invested in ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, and shrewdly integrated the start-up's generative AI tools into its own applications. It also launched new hardware devices and expanded Xbox's gaming business with more acquisitions and cloud-based services.

That's why Microsoft's annual revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2024 (which ended last June) as its EPS grew at a CAGR of 16%. Analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow 14% and 11%, respectively, in fiscal 2025.

Those double-digit growth rates indicate Microsoft still has room to run. But it also has a market cap of $3.1 trillion, making it the world's third-most valuable company, and its stock isn't cheap at 32 times forward earnings. In other words, a lot of growth has already been baked into Microsoft's stock price -- and it might stay in its holding pattern until its profits catch up to its valuations again. Any near-term issues with Azure, its main growth engine, could also limit its upside potential.

That said, I believe it's still smarter to buy Microsoft as a long-term AI play than Lumen. It's bigger, growing faster, more broadly diversified, and has a much wider moat. Lumen might generate bigger near-term gains than Microsoft, but it could quickly fizzle out if the high costs of its big AI connectivity deals crush its long-term margins.",MSFT,yes,fmp,1150

2024-10-21 14:12:07,5 Stocks to Buy for a Harris Presidency,https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/stocks-to-buy-for-a-harris-presidency,"The race to the White House is in its final stretch, meaning the election campaigns for both Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are really heating up.

Harris took the top spot on the Democratic ticket in late July when President Joe Biden unexpectedly ended his bid for a second term in the White House. He quickly endorsed Vice President Harris, who named Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate.

While the actual winner of the election doesn't have a direct impact on the stock market, that person's policies can affect certain sectors and industries.

Take the Biden-Harris administration's strategy to revitalize domestic manufacturing and strengthen U.S. supply chains. This resulted in the 2022 passage of the CHIPS and Science Act that invests in the semiconductor industry and aims to ""boost American semiconductor research, development, and production, ensuring U.S. leadership in the technology that forms the foundation of everything from automobiles to household appliances to defense systems.""

This law includes $39 billion that's earmarked for manufacturing incentives and another $13 billion in research and development and workforce development. While the impact won't be immediate, the additional resources will likely create tailwinds for down the road.

But chipmakers aren't the only area of the market that could be impacted if Kamala Harris wins the election. Indeed, here are five stocks to buy for a Harris presidency, representing women's healthcare, infrastructure, electric vehicles (EVs), clean energy and artificial intelligence (AI).

We also looked at stocks to buy for a Trump presidency, so you have ideas for whichever way the election goes.

Organon (OGN) is a global healthcare company focused on women's health issues. Although it has three product portfolios: Women's Health, Biosimilars, and Established Brands, it is Harris' focus on women's health that could help OGN gain relevance in the U.S. market.

Currently, Organon generates 77% of its revenue outside the U.S. Its three largest markets are Europe and Canada, which made up a combined 28% of OGN's $1.61 billion in total Q2 revenue, Asia, Pacific and Japan (17%), and Latin America, Middle East, Russia and Africa (16%).

In the second quarter ended June 30, the company's Women's Health portfolio had revenue of $449 million, 3% higher than a year earlier. However, its Q2 Nexplanon revenue – a birth control implant – grew by 13% year-over-year to $242 million, or 54% of its total Women's Health revenue.

Interestingly, according to the Q2 2024 10-Q report, Organon's U.S. Nexplanon revenue accounted for 71% of the product's total revenue in the quarter. While the Supreme Court and red states will have something to say about any birth control products, a Harris presidency should provide greater protection for Nexplanon than a Trump one would.

As for its other two groups of products, Biosimilars had a healthy 22% year-over-year increase in Q2 2024 revenue to $164 million. However, while drugs like Hadlima (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ontruzant (HER2+ breast cancer) are growing nicely, they barely account for 10% of Organon's quarterly sales.

Organon's Established Brands business accounts for over half of its revenue. These drugs, in some cases years ago, lost their market exclusivity. Its drugs include Zetia, which lowers bad cholesterol levels for people with high cholesterol.

Sterling Infrastructure (STRL) is aptly named because the Texas-based company provides infrastructure solutions in three key areas: e-infrastructure, transportation and building.

Its business once almost solely focused on heavy civil construction projects, building bridges, roadways, and other types of large-scale infrastructure. However, since 2016, it has moved to diversify its revenue streams into higher-margin infrastructure-related projects.

Its E-Infrastructure Solutions segment (48% of 2023 revenue) includes site-development services for data centers, e-commerce distribution centers, manufacturing and other uses, primarily for larger, well-established companies. In 2023, four customers accounted for 40% of the segment's total revenue.

The company's second-highest revenue generator is its Transportation Solutions division, at 32%. This is the legacy part of its business which existed before its business strategy change in 2016. Building Solutions accounts for the remaining 20% of its revenue. The segment builds residential and commercial concrete foundations for single-family and multi-family homes, parking garages and other concrete work, and plumbing services for new single-family homes.

STRL's shift in strategy appears to be working. In early August, Sterling reported Q2 results, which included a 12% year-over-year increase in revenue to $582.8 million and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $87.0 million, up 18% from a year ago.

And the industrial stock could see more infrastructure-related growth if Kamala Harris wins the election in November. Indeed, as part of the Biden administration, Harris supported the 2021 passage of the that aims to ""create good-paying jobs, boost domestic manufacturing, strengthen supply chains, and grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up.""

Kamala Harris appears to be following in the footsteps of several of Joe Biden's economic plans. Harris, who hails from California – the state with the highest adoption rate for electric vehicles – is a big supporter of the American EV industry.

The vice president, on behalf of the Biden administration, went to Detroit in May with a $100 million check for small- and medium-sized auto manufacturers. The funds were for these companies to upgrade their production of EVs.

""This investment will help to keep our auto supply chains here in America,"" said Harris at the time, as reported by ABC News. And this ""strengthens America's economy overall and will keep those jobs here in Detroit.""

Biden, and now Harris, back pro-electric-vehicle policies such as claiming an of up to $7,500 per vehicle, $1.7 billion in federal grants like the one mentioned above, and $7.5 billion paid out to states to build a national charging network.

These all favor American EV makers such as Rivian Automotive (RIVN), which currently produces the R1T pickup and R1S SUV, as well as commercial delivery vans for Amazon.com (AMZN) and others.

Analysts generally like Rivian. Of the 27 that cover the stock tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 10 say it's a Strong Buy, four call it a Buy, 12 have it at Hold and one rates it at Sell. This works out to a consensus Buy recommendation.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives is one of those with an Outperform (Buy) rating on RIVN. The company is powering through some speed bumps at the moment, Ives wrote in an August 7 report. Earlier this year, Rivian ""made some significant improvements on the R1 lineup from a production standpoint,"" and this ""should positively impact the margin story looking forward.""

Additionally, Rivian is utilizing Volkswagen's $5 billion investment in the company ""to support future growth while vertically integrating its software platform and electrical architecture, achieving further cost savings and delivering improved vehicles down the line.""

NextEra Energy (NEE) is the parent of Florida Power & Light, America's largest rate-regulated utility, with 5.9 million customer accounts, or roughly 12 million people across the Sunshine State. NEE is also the world's largest producer of clean, renewable energy.

Kamala Harris is a big supporter of clean energy. As Reuters recently reported, she continues to remind voters that Trump and the Republicans want ""to surrender our fight against the climate crisis.""

It's likely the policies of her 2019 campaign to be the Democratic presidential nominee, which included a $10 trillion plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – have likely softened.

Still, in the , Harris says that she and Governor Walz ""will always fight for the freedom to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis.""

As such, NextEra is one of the stocks that could benefit from a Harris presidency. Shares have already outperformed in 2024, up 42% for the year to date on a total return basis (price change plus dividends) vs 24% for the S&P 500. have done well as investors bet that the demand for power generation will continue to rise in the years ahead.

""We believe NEE deserves to trade at a premium given above-average population growth in its Florida service territory, as well as its favorable regulatory return on capital and strong new project pipeline,"" wrote Argus Research analyst Marie Ferguson (Buy) in a July 25 note.

She adds that NEE ""The company should also see long-term benefits from its focus on renewable energy, including higher margins and tax credits for renewable energy development under the Inflation Reduction Act.""

Kamala Harris held the role of AI czar in the Biden White House, which makes sense given her ties to California and the Bay Area. She's very interested in working with tech companies to develop AI that is both good for the economy and .

In November, Harris gave a speech about the future of AI at the U.S. Embassy in London.

""AI has the potential to do profound good to develop powerful new medicines to treat and even cure the diseases that have for generations plagued humanity, to dramatically improve agricultural production to help address global food insecurity, and to save countless lives in the fight against the climate crisis,"" .

However, the vice president was adamant that the Biden administration would work with Congress to implement laws protecting Americans from AI and privacy breaches.

Harris is primarily interested in holding corporations accountable for their actions. That trait developed over many years as the district attorney of San Francisco and California's attorney general.

However, she's also known to be willing to listen to both sides of an argument or discussion. Microsoft (MSFT) should be given a seat at the AI table in Washington and could benefit from a Harris White House if it plays by the books.

Microsoft's investments in AI are already starting to bear fruit. In its fiscal fourth-quarter results, the company said revenue jumped 15% year-over-year to $64.7 billion. Its cloud revenue, which includes AI, was 21% higher to $36.8 billion. Earnings were up 10% at $2.95 per share.

CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino reiterated the firm's Strong Buy rating on Microsoft stock after earnings. ""On the surface, we view the June quarter results as largely in line across MSFT's core businesses and believe that AI monetization is incrementally improving,"" Zino said.

Zino isn't alone in his bullish outlook. Of the 57 analysts following the tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 38 say it's a Strong Buy, 14 have it at Buy and five call it a Hold. This works out to a consensus Strong Buy recommendation and makes MSFT one of the best-rated .

2024-10-21 12:58:08,Microsoft launches ‘AI employees' that can perform some business tasks,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/21/microsoft-launches-ai-employees-that-can-perform-some-business-tasks,"Microsoft is introducing autonomous artificial intelligence agents, or virtual employees, that can perform tasks such as handling client queries and identifying sales leads, as the tech sector strives to show investors that the AI boom can produce indispensable products.

The US tech company is giving customers the ability to build their own AI agents as well as releasing 10 off-the-shelf bots that can carry out a range of roles including supply chain management and customer service.

Early adopters of the Copilot Studio product, which launches next month, include the blue chip consulting firm McKinsey, which is building an agent to process new client inquiries by carrying out tasks such as scheduling follow-up meetings. Other early users include law firm Clifford Chance and retailer Pets at Home.

Microsoft is flagging AI agents, which carry out tasks without human intervention, as an example of the technology’s ability to increase productivity – a measure of economic efficiency, or the amount of output generated by a worker for each hour worked.

Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, who disclosed the AI agents at a company event in London, said the tool would reduce “drudgery” and raise productivity by freeing up time to carry out more valuable tasks.

“These tools are fundamentally changing outsourcing, increasing value and reducing waste,” he said.

Nadella described Copilot Studio, which does not require coding expertise from its users, as a “no-code way for you to be able to build agents”. Microsoft is powering the agents with several AI models developed in-house and by OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.

Microsoft is also developing an AI agent that can carry out transactions on behalf of users. The company’s head of AI, Mustafa Suleyman, has said he has seen “stunning demos” where the agent makes a purchase independently, but that it has also suffered “car crash moments” in development. Sulyeman added, nonetheless, that an agent with these capabilities will emerge “in quarters, not years”.

Asked about fears of AI’s impact on employment, Charles Lamanna, a corporate vice-president at Microsoft, told the Guardian that agents would do away with the “mundane, monotonous” aspects of a job.

“I think it’s much more of an enabler and an empowerment tool than anything else,” he said.

Lamanna said the advent of AI tools such as agents in the modern office environment is comparable to the arrival of personal computers several decades ago.

“The personal computer didn’t show up on every desk to begin with but eventually it was on every desk because it brought so much capability and information to the fingertips of every employee,” he said.

“We think that AI is going to have the same type of journey. It’s showing up in a subset of departments and processes, but it’s only a matter of time till it shows up to all parts of an organisation.”

Andrew Rogoyski, a director at the Institute for People-Centred AI, at the University of Surrey, said AI agents could help tech companies to produce a return for investors who backed the technology strongly. In June, Goldman Sachs asked if a $1tn investment in AI over the next few years will “ever pay off”.

“AI companies have consumed a lot of investment money and need to generate some returns,” said Rogoyski. “Assistive agents is a way of showing everyday benefits, although how much revenue these will generate is an open question.”

However, he issued a warning that agents have been discussed as a concept for years but that “we’ve yet to deliver an agent that is as capable as a human worker”.",MSFT,yes,fmp,723

Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) was an earlier winner in artificial intelligence (AI) thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. But lately, investors have been moving away from the enterprise software giant, enticed by Apple's new Apple Intelligence AI platform, and Nvidia's Blackwell platform.

Microsoft has lost its title of the world's most valuable company to Apple and recently fell behind Nvidia for the second-most valuable company in the world. The stock is now down 10% from its peak in July, and it's missed out on the latest rally in tech stocks as the Nasdaq Composite is back near all-time highs.

However, one analyst sees upside potential in Microsoft.

In a note on Friday morning, KeyCorp hiked its price target on Microsoft from $490 to $505 and maintained an overweight rating on the stock. The research firm said a recent survey showed a rebound in the company's performance and IT budgets heading into next year. KeyBanc found that IT budgets were now expected to grow 4.4% in 2025, compared with an earlier forecast of 3.2%.

That finding certainly looks like a positive for Microsoft as corporate IT spending is a primary determinant of its growth. KeyBanc's new price target implies a 21% upside in the stock.

Microsoft remains the dominant enterprise software company, but there are valid questions facing the stock, including its valuation at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35 and its ability to justify its investments in AI, as the company faces some skepticism on that front.

Additionally, The New York Times just reported that its partnership with OpenAI is facing some tensions as Microsoft wants a payoff from its investment in OpenAI and is interested in investing in other AI start-ups.

At its ""AI Tour"" event in London on Monday, Microsoft revealed plans to allow organizations to create their own autonomous agents within Copilot Studio, the U.S. tech giant's platform for customizing and building so-called ""copilot"" assistants. These agents had previously been available in private preview after Microsoft announced them initially in May. Starting next month, they'll move into public preview, meaning more organizations can start building AI agents of their own. AI agents can act as virtual workers that can carry out a series of tasks without supervision. They are touted as a major evolution of large language model-based AI from chat interfaces, creating an experience that blends more seamlessly into the background. Beyond adding the ability to create autonomous agents in Copilot Studio, Microsoft said it would also launch 10 new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365, the company's suite of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management apps.

How can AI agents be used?

Jared Spataro, Microsoft's corporate vice president of modern work and business applications, on Monday displayed an example of an AI agent developed at consulting firm McKinsey. The agent was shown as it parsed out an email to find out what the communication is about, checked its history, mapped it to industry-standard terms, and then found the right person in the firm to take the next step before writing and summarizing a response. It may seem like ""magic,"" but the firm was able to develop its own AI agent just by using human language, not programming languages, according to Spataro.

""We're excited about this because of the business value it can drive,"" he noted, adding that McKinsey found it could reduce lead time by as much as 90%.

Microsoft is doubling down on AI agents at a time when competition is intensifying up in the red-hot artificial intelligence space. Last month, at its annual Dreamforce showcase in San Francisco, Salesforce showed off a new platform called Agentforce, which allows enterprise organizations to spin up their own AI agents. Zahra Bahrololoumi, Salesforce's CEO of U.K. and Ireland, criticized the copilot model of AI assistants as not serving the needs of enterprises that well.

""All of these copilots activated on the edge, or in email — they're not connected to or grounded within the context of customer data,"" Bahrololoumi told CNBC in an interview earlier this month. ""How is it going to represent a company accurately and responsibly? It isn't."" ""I think we won't see so many copilots for enterprise AI activity,"" she added. ""I'm not saying copilots won't exist for other purposes. But in the context of enterprise, for autonomous enterprises to be able to plan, execute and take action — you're no longer in Copilot there."" Microsoft declined to comment on Bahrololoumi's remarks when contacted by CNBC. Microsoft and Salesforce have a storied feud. Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff once called on European regulators to investigate Microsoft's deal to buy LinkedIn, suggesting it was in breach of competition rules.",MSFT,yes,fmp,655

Last week, the S&P 500 reached a new all-time high, marking a 23% year-to-date gain, while the Dow Jones closed above the 43,000 mark for the first time, signaling continued optimism about market growth.

According to Bank of America, as earnings season kicked off, 30 companies in the S&P 500 surpassed earnings expectations by an average of 5%, up from 3% at the start of the last quarter. An additional 41 S&P 500 companies reported results last week. However, with the S&P 500 currently trading at around 21.8 times forward earnings—well above its long-term average of 15.7—some analysts caution that stock valuations may be stretched. Any disappointment in these reports could trigger a market correction as investors reassess valuations.

As we look ahead to big tech’s upcoming releases, here’s what to watch for:

Microsoft delivered stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter, with total revenue rising 15% year-over-year. Net income climbed to $22.04 billion, up from $20.08 billion in the same quarter last year, translating to $2.69 per share.

While these results were solid, investor attention was focused on Azure’s performance, which fell below expectations for the first time since 2022. Azure and other cloud services posted 29% revenue growth, but this missed consensus estimates, sparking concerns about whether Microsoft’s cloud unit is losing momentum in an increasingly competitive market.

Despite the Azure miss, Microsoft’s management remains optimistic about future growth, suggesting potential acceleration in the coming quarters. However, investors remain cautious, as Azure’s performance is now a critical driver of Microsoft’s overall growth, especially as cloud computing continues to gain importance across industries.",MSFT,yes,fmp,386
2024-10-20 05:51:00,3 Stocks That Could Be Big Winners if Kamala Harris Wins but the GOP Controls Congress,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/20/3-stocks-that-could-be-big-winners-if-kamala-harri/,"A divided government could be optimal for these stocks.

Americans could be looking at a couple more years of a divided government. Vice President Kamala Harris has an average 2.8% lead over former President Donald Trump across 256 polls of the presidential race. Decision Desk HQ's models show a 72% chance of Republicans regaining a majority in the Senate and a 53% chance of holding onto a majority in the House of Representatives.

Of course, polls don't decide elections; voters do. It's not too soon for investors to evaluate what they might do based on the November results, though. What if the polls turn out to be right? Here are three stocks that could be big winners if Harris wins but the GOP controls Congress.

Democrats and Republicans don't agree with each other on many topics. However, the need for the U.S. to be the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) is one area where they're on the same page. Members of both major political parties are working together on the House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence to ""explore how Congress can ensure America continues to lead the world in AI innovation while considering guardrails that may be appropriate to safeguard the nation against current and emerging threats.""

Broadcom (AVGO 0.96%) could benefit from bipartisan support of U.S. AI leadership. The California-based company is a top provider of semiconductors and networking infrastructure used in AI data centers. Seven of the eight-biggest AI clusters in the world rely on Broadcom's Ethernet networking technology.

With Harris as president, Broadcom won't be negatively impacted by the steep tariffs that Trump has proposed. On the other hand, with the GOP controlling Congress, Harris probably couldn't get her proposed corporate tax increases passed. It's a win-win proposition for Broadcom.

Regardless of who the next president is or which party has a majority in Congress, though, Broadcom's long-term prospects look strong. As AI becomes more powerful, organizations will need to upgrade their servers, networks, and data-storage devices. This should drive demand for Broadcom's products for years to come.

Many Democrats and Republicans believe in improving the nation's infrastructure as well as agreeing on the importance of U.S. dominance in AI. Politicians of all stripes want the economy to be strong. History shows that the U.S. economy has performed better under Democratic presidents than Republican presidents since World War II. But the stock market has performed best when those Democratic presidents had at least one house of Congress controlled by the GOP.

A divided government with Harris as president could be an ideal scenario for Brookfield Infrastructure (BIP 0.99%) (BIPC -0.78%). The company operates pipelines, terminals, rail, and other infrastructure assets that benefit from a booming economy. It also owns data centers and semiconductor-manufacturing foundries, both of which are growth markets partly due to the AI tailwind.

Income investors will especially like Brookfield Infrastructure's distributions. Its limited partnership units trading under the BIP ticker offer a forward-distribution yield of 4.5%. Its corporate shares trading under the BIPC ticker offer a forward-distribution yield of 3.8%. These distributions have increased by a compound annual growth rate of 9% since 2009.

What if the economy doesn't fare well with Harris in the White House and Republicans controlling the House and/or Senate? Brookfield Infrastructure's business is remarkably resilient with 90% of its funds from operations (FFO) contracted or regulated.

Harris and Republicans could also find common ground on cybersecurity. The vice president has been an advocate for protecting IT infrastructure against threats in the past. The GOP's 2024 platform included language about cybersecurity. The views of both parties tie in with their AI priorities.

Few companies stand at the forefront of both AI and cybersecurity as much as Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%). The company is the second-largest cloud-service provider and offers extensive AI capabilities. It has integrated AI throughout its productivity-software applications. Microsoft also markets cybersecurity products and services.

I think Microsoft would keep up its winning ways with Democrats or Republicans in power. The opportunities with AI are so big that the company can be successful even if legislators put a few roadblocks in its path.",MSFT,yes,fmp,855

Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) just gave investors a reason to smile by cranking up its quarterly dividend payout by nearly 11% in September. But this isn't exactly a surprise. Microsoft has been paying dividends since 2003 and has consistently upped those payouts for nearly two decades.

Granted, most investors tend to focus on Microsoft's impressive growth story and its big bets on artificial intelligence (AI) -- and that makes sense. But you might still be curious about just how much you can earn in dividends if you own this stock.

With a current dividend yield of around 0.8%, Microsoft is far from being the highest-yielding option out there. Still, it offers a steady stream of income alongside its growth potential.

Your first $1000 in dividend income from Microsoft

When investing in dividend-paying assets, a common milestone to shoot for is earning your first $1,000 in dividend income. Let's run the numbers for Microsoft.

Microsoft recently bumped its quarterly dividend from $0.75 per share to $0.83 per share. That comes out to $3.32 annually. To earn $1,000 a year in dividends, you'd need to own about 302 shares. At Microsoft's current share price of around $417, you'd need to invest about $126,000 to reach your goal.

Is it worth it? Maybe not if you're strictly chasing high yields. But if you're looking for long-term growth potential and steady dividend hikes, Microsoft could be worth considering. Its heavy investments in AI might pressure earnings now, but they could drive major growth down the road. Plus, with a market cap of over $3 trillion and a spot among the ""Magnificent Seven,"" you'd own a stake in one of the largest companies in the world.

Do your research and listen to the earnings calls to get a sense of where Microsoft is headed. And if you want to lock in the next dividend payout, make sure to grab shares before the ex-dividend date on Nov. 21 to secure your quarterly check in December.",MSFT,yes,fmp,436

Sunday marks the official start of a health-care technology conference called HLTH, which is expected to draw more than 12,000 industry leaders this year. CNBC will be on the ground. Based on the speaking agenda and announcements leading up to the conference, AI tools to conquer administrative burdens will be the star of this year's show. Doctors and nurses are responsible for mountains of documentation as they work to keep up with patient records, interface with insurance companies and comply with regulators. Often, these tasks are painstakingly manual, in part because health data is siloed and stored across multiple vendors and formats. The daunting administrative workload is a major cause of burnout in the industry, and it's part of the reason a nationwide shortage of 100,000 health-care workers is expected by 2028, according to consulting firm Mercer. Tech companies, eager to carve out a piece of a market that could top $6.8 trillion in spending by the decade's end, argue that their generative AI tools can help.

Google, for instance, said it's working to expand its health-care customer base by tackling administrative burden with AI. On Thursday, the company announced the general availability of Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, which it introduced in a trial capacity during HLTH last year. Vertex AI Search for Healthcare allows developers to build tools to help doctors quickly search for information across disparate medical records, Google said. New features within Google's Healthcare Data Engine, which helps organizations build the platforms they need to support generative AI, are also now available, the company said. Google on Thursday released the results of a survey that said clinicians spend nearly 28 hours a week on administrative tasks. In the survey, 80% of providers said this clerical work takes away from their time with patients, and 91% said they feel positive about using AI to streamline these tasks.

Similarly, Microsoft on Oct. 11 announced its collection of tools that aim to lessen clinicians' administrative workload, including medical imaging models, a health-care agent service and an automated documentation solution for nurses, most of which are still in the early stages of development. Microsoft already offers an automated documentation tool for doctors through its subsidiary, Nuance Communications, which it acquired in a $16 billion deal in 2021. The tool, called DAX Copilot, uses AI to transcribe doctors' visits with patients and turn them into clinical notes and summaries. Ideally, this means doctors don't have to spend time typing out these notes themselves. Nurses and doctors complete different types of documentation during their shifts, so Microsoft said it's building a separate tool for nurses that's best suited to their workflows. AI scribe tools such as DAX Copilot have exploded in popularity this year, and Nuance's competitors, such as Abridge, which has reportedly raised more than $460 million, and Suki, which has raised $165 million, will also be at the HLTH conference. Dr. Shiv Rao, the founder and CEO of Abridge, told CNBC in March that the rate at which the health-care industry has adopted this new form of clinical documentation feels ""historic.""

For most people, $50,000 is a nice sum of money. In fact, you can buy a pretty nice car with that amount. However, instead of spending it, the best move over the long term would be to invest.

And when it comes to investing, technology stocks are one of the first places long-term investors should look. As technology, like artificial intelligence (AI), continues to transform the world we live in, technology companies have become the biggest stock market winners.

Let's look at two top tech stocks investors can buy today that are riding the AI wave. One is the leader on the hardware side, while the other is the leader on the software side. While investing $50,000 in these names would be nice, you can, of course, start with any amount.

No company has been a bigger winner from AI than Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%), and there doesn't appear to be anything on the horizon that will stop its momentum. The company's graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of the AI infrastructure buildout, and the company recently called demand for its newest Blackwell chips ""insane.""

Nvidia has been able to take a more than 80% market share in the GPU space through its chips' strong performance, but more importantly through its CUDA software platform. Long before AI was the next big thing, CUDA became the standard platform on which developers learned to program GPUs. This created a wide moat around its booming GPU business.

Meanwhile, AI infrastructure is currently seeing no letup in demand, as major tech companies pile money into the space to develop more sophisticated AI models. As AI models advance, they need more computing power for training, and that power comes from Nvidia's GPUs. For example, Alphabet has said its new Llama 4 large language model (LLM) would need 10 times the compute power of its predecessor, while xAI's Grok 3 LLM used 5 times the number of GPUs as Grok 2. The large tech companies investing in AI infrastructure have all indicated that their spending will continue to ramp up, with Oracle saying it sees no end to AI infrastructure spending over the next five to 10 years. This all benefits Nvidia.

Despite the stock's strong performance, it is still attractively priced, trading a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of under 35 based on next year's analyst estimate and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of about 0.9. A PEG under 1 is generally viewed as undervalued, and growth stocks often carry PEGs well above 1.

Another company riding the AI wave is Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%), which was one of the first large tech companies to go all-in on the technology when it made a large investment in and formed a partnership with OpenAI.

Thus far, its Azure cloud computing unit has been the company's biggest AI beneficiary, as organizations turn to its platform to create their own AI solutions. This is a consumption-based business where users are only charged for the resources they use, and so far, usage has been very strong. This can been seen in the company's results, with Azure growing revenue around 29% to 30% the past few quarters.

Cloud computing isn't the only area the company is looking at AI to help power growth. Its GitHub Developer platform as been another big AI winner, as customers turned to its AI assistant, Copilot, which can make suggestions as developers type and even complete coding tasks.

However, the next big opportunity for the company could be with its Microsoft 365 Copilot. The company recently introduced a number of improved Copilots for Microsoft 365, which it will use to help lure organizations to its Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on. With these new features, users will be able to do things like work with the programming language Python in Excel through only natural language, pull in data from different types of sources with Word Copilot, and create presentations using only natural language with Copilot for Powerpoint.

At the cost of $30 a month per user for its Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on, this is a huge potential growth opportunity for Microsoft, as its 365 Copilot costs more than many of its subscriptions to Microsoft 365. To purchase the Microsoft Copilot, users are required to have a separate license to a qualifying plan, which can range from as little as $4.75 per user per month for its basic business plan without Teams to $22 per user per month for its premium business subscription with Teams, which also includes cybersecurity and identity management features. Some enterprise plans with more features can cost more.

Microsoft has proven to be an adaptive and innovative company, which has helped it grow to be one of the largest companies in the world. It is these attributes, along with the AI opportunity in front of it, that make it a great long-term investment.",MSFT,yes,fmp,1012
2024-10-18 17:15:00,Where Will Microsoft Stock Be in 3 Years?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/18/where-will-microsoft-stock-be-in-3-years/,"Microsoft's AI-powered growth should help the stock regain its mojo following a disappointing 2024.

Shares of Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) have delivered steady gains of 41% in the past three years, edging the S&P 500 index's jump of 34% by a small margin, but the world's third-largest company by market cap has failed to gather any steam in 2024.

More specifically, Microsoft stock has delivered just 11% gains this year, underperforming the S&P 500 index by a big margin. The stock's underperformance may seem a tad surprising considering that it has been clocking healthy growth quarter after quarter. In this article, we will take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects for the next three years and check if the tech giant can overcome a disappointing 2024 to become a long-term winner.

AI has the potential to lift Microsoft's growth significantly

Microsoft's revenue in the recently concluded fiscal year 2024 (which ended on June 30) increased by 15% year over year in constant-currency terms to $245 billion. This healthy double-digit growth was driven by the growing demand for the company's Microsoft 365 office collaboration and productivity tools, an impressive jump in its Azure revenue, and a 9% jump in search and news-advertising revenue.

The Azure business was the cornerstone of Microsoft's growth in fiscal 2024. It recorded a 33% year-over-year increase in revenue from Azure and other cloud-services last year, of which nine percentage points were attributable to artificial intelligence (AI). It is worth noting that AI's contribution to Microsoft's Azure business increased throughout the year, jumping from five percentage points in the fiscal first quarter to 11 percentage points in fiscal Q4.

It is easy to see why Microsoft's Azure cloud service is getting a nice shot in the arm thanks to AI. After all, the demand for cloud-based AI services is growing at an incredible pace. Goldman Sachs estimates that the global cloud-computing market could generate $2 trillion in revenue by 2030 as compared to $496 billion in 2023. More importantly, generative AI is expected to account for 10% to 15% of global-cloud spending by the end of the decade.

Microsoft is already capitalizing on this lucrative trend by giving customers access to a big pool of large language models (LLMs) on its cloud platform with which they can develop and deploy AI models. As CEO Satya Nadella remarked on the July earnings-conference call:

Microsoft also points out that its models-as-a-service offering has also gained impressive traction, with the number of paid customers doubling quarter over quarter in fiscal Q4. The tech giant offers customers access to various kinds of models on rent so that they can develop and deploy AI applications. So, with the demand for AI services in the cloud set to grow substantially in the coming years, Microsoft should ideally witness further acceleration in its Azure revenue.

On the other hand, Microsoft's Office 365 business is also getting a nice lift thanks to AI. According to Nadella, ""the number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter over quarter"" in fiscal Q4, with the number of customers using Copilot jumping 60% sequentially. Microsoft Copilot is a generative AI assistant that allows users to ""complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings and automate business workflows and processes.""

Again, this could be a potentially lucrative market for Microsoft as the market for AI-powered productivity tools is expected to grow at an annual rate of almost 27% through the end of the decade, according to Grand View Research. The size of the market was worth an estimated $6.9 billion last year, but it could hit $36 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade.

In all, the emergence of new growth opportunities for Microsoft thanks to AI should ideally help the company sustain its healthy levels of growth over the next three years. This is precisely what consensus estimates suggest, as the chart below shows.

MSFT Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts.

Stronger earnings growth could send the stock on a nice bull run

Microsoft reported a 20% year-over-year jump in non-GAAP earnings in fiscal 2024 to $11.80 per share. Though analysts are forecasting a smaller jump in the current fiscal year, Microsoft's earnings growth is expected to pick up pace in fiscal years 2026 and 2027.

The smaller increase in Microsoft's fiscal 2025 earnings can be attributed to the company's aggressive capital spending. Last year, Microsoft's capital expenditure jumped 75% from the preceding year to $55.7 billion, and it is on track to increase its capex once again in fiscal 2025 thanks to its focus on building out its cloud and AI infrastructure.

While the elevated levels of spending will weigh on Microsoft's bottom-line growth in the short run, the company believes that it should help it monetize the growing demand for AI over the next 15 years and longer. That's why investors would do well to look at the bigger picture.

Moreover, it's clear that Microsoft's earnings growth is forecasted to accelerate over the next couple of years. Assuming its earnings indeed jump to $17.98 per share in fiscal 2027 and it trades at 30 times earnings at that time -- in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's price-to-earnings ratio -- its stock price could hit $540. That would represent a 29% jump from current levels.

However, if Microsoft is able to achieve stronger levels of growth and the market decides to reward it with a higher-earnings multiple, it could deliver stronger gains over the next three years. So, investors would do well to add this tech giant to their portfolios even though it has underperformed so far in 2024 as its AI-fueled growth could help it step on the gas.",MSFT,yes,fmp,1204
2024-10-18 13:30:42,"OpenAI, Microsoft in $14B tussle as AI giant changes into for-profit company: report",https://nypost.com/2024/10/18/business/openai-microsoft-in-14b-tussle-over-equity-rights-in-ai-giant-report/,"Microsoft is reportedly in a tussle with OpenAI over what size piece it will get of the artificial intelligence juggernaut as the latter prepares to transform itself from nonprofit to for-profit company.

Both firms have turned to investment banks for advice in the high-stakes negotiations as Microsoft seeks a major slug of equity in OpenAI in exchange for the $14 billion in cash it has injected into the company thus far, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Microsoft, headed by CEO Satya Nadella, has hired Morgan Stanley, the paper reported, citing unnamed sources close to the situation.

OpenAI — headed by 39-year-old tech tycoon Sam Altman — has meanwhile hired Goldman Sachs, the sources said.

Microsoft is OpenAI’s biggest investor and began its massive cash infusions in 2019.

The company was a participant in a recently closed $6.6 billion fundraising round that valued OpenAI at a whopping $157 billion – even though it is expected to lose $5 billion this year.

Aside from the size of Microsoft’s equity take, the companies are expected to negotiate the extent of its governance rights, the report said.

The Post has reached out to Microsoft and OpenAI for comment.

OpenAI’s board is planning to restructure as a for-profit benefit corporation, in which company leaders weigh both societal impact and profit when making decisions, according to multiple reports.

The nonprofit entity that has governed OpenAI since 2015 will continue to exist and retain a stake in the for-profit entity, but it will no longer be in charge.

OpenAI’s nonprofit board briefly ousted Altman from the CEO job last fall, only to see him retake the helm after Nadella and other key investors intervened.

The jockeying over equity rights is playing out amid signs of behind-the-scenes tension between Microsoft and OpenAI, according to a separate report.

Altman and his allies were miffed at Microsoft’s decision to hire AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman, the New York Times reported.

Suleyman is head of Microsoft’s in-house consumer AI unit and reports directly to Nadella.

Suleyman cofounded the Google-owned DeepMind research lab and later ran the startup Inflection AI. Most of the latter’s staff followed Suleyman to Microsoft.

Some OpenAI staffers bristled at a recent incident in which Suleyman reportedly lambasted the startup for not delivering new AI technology to Microsoft colleagues as quickly as he thought they should, according to the Times.

Others at Altman’s firm were said to be irritated that Microsoft engineers had bypassed mutual agreed protocols while downloading OpenAI software.

Meanwhile, OpenAI has reportedly pushed Microsoft for more favorable terms as it looks to secure more computing power to run its AI programs – and to allow it to seek sources outside the company.

Internal documents obtained by the Times suggest OpenAI’s computing costs will surge as high as $37.5 billion per year by 2029.

Microsoft and other key investors in the most recent fundraising round reportedly have the right to renegotiate OpenAI’s valuation – or receive their money back entirely – if the for-profit shift isn’t complete within two years.

Altman is also expected to receive an equity stake in the for-profit entity – though he pushed back on one Bloomberg report stating that he could receive a 7% slice worth more than $10 billion, calling it “ludicrous.”",MSFT,yes,fmp,686

Among other issues, Microsoft and OpenAI must resolve how much equity will go to CEO Sam Altman and OpenAI employees, as well as which specific governance rights Microsoft will have. Once OpenAI converts to a for-profit, it’ll become a public-benefit corporation, but with a nonprofit component that’ll own equity in the restructured company.

2024-10-18 11:03:43,2 stocks to watch as tech giants bet big on nuclear energy,https://finbold.com/2-stocks-to-watch-as-tech-giants-bet-big-on-nuclear-energy/,"As the race to advance artificial intelligence (AI) intensifies, tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are making strategic moves toward nuclear energy to meet their rapidly growing power needs.

This shift is transforming the energy landscape and positioning nuclear power as a key resource for sustaining the immense, round-the-clock operations of AI-driven data centers.

While other forms of renewable energy, such as wind and solar, exist, nuclear energy is emerging as a more reliable solution for powering AI and cloud computing infrastructures, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

With major tech companies increasingly turning to nuclear energy, the sector is seeing a surge in interest and investment.

Microsoft’s recent agreement to purchase power from the revived Three Mile Island nuclear plant and Google’s partnership with Kairos Power to deploy small modular reactors (SMRs) signal a broader shift toward nuclear energy as the solution to meeting AI and cloud computing’s massive energy demands.

Amazon has also joined the push, committing $500 million toward developing small nuclear reactor technology.

The growing demand for nuclear energy is fueling a significant surge in stocks linked to the nuclear sector, especially those involved in uranium mining and nuclear fuel technology. Indeed, Finbold reported how the AI boom fuels the demand for uranium as a promising commodity.

Two standout stocks benefiting from this momentum are Cameco Corporation (NYSE: CCJ) and Centrus Energy Corporation (NYSE: LEU). Both are set to capitalize on the rising need for nuclear energy, supported by major tech investments and government initiatives.

Cameco Corporation, a leading Canadian uranium producer, plays a crucial role in the global uranium market by supplying essential raw materials for nuclear energy.

As the world’s second-largest uranium producer, Cameco operates high-grade uranium mines in Saskatchewan, Canada, and is well-positioned for long-term growth.

CEO Tim Gitzel expects strong earnings growth in 2024, driven by rising global demand for nuclear power. Despite a recent dip in uranium prices, Cameco’s earnings are projected to rise significantly through 2025, supported by double-digit revenue growth.

The stock has surged 500% over the past five years, with a 50% increase since early September alone, bringing its current price to $56.75.

It has gained 38% in the past month, and analysts maintain a strong buy consensus, with a price target of $66.56, indicating a potential 17.45% upside.

Cameco’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 57.12 reflects high growth expectations, backed by robust financials, including $1.94 billion in revenue and $187.88 million in earnings over the past 12 months.

Centrus Energy is a leader in nuclear fuel technology, focusing on the production of low-enriched uranium (LEU) and advancing high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) technology.

This month, Centrus Energy announced that its subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating, LLC, received a U.S. Department of Energy award to develop technology that converts high-assay, low-enriched uranium from uranium hexafluoride to uranium oxide or metal forms.

These contracts, which allow up to $2.7 billion in government funding, show the growing demand for nuclear fuel technology.

Centrus Energy’s stock has surged over 115% in the past month, buoyed by strong financial performance and ongoing innovation.

The stock is currently priced at $90.34. Analysts maintain a “Buy” rating for the stock, citing its long-term growth potential despite short-term market volatility.

Over the past 52 weeks, Centrus has seen a 53.30% rise in its stock price. With a P/E ratio of 14.50, the stock is considered fairly valued.

While some analysts forecast near-term price corrections, the long-term outlook remains bullish, making Centrus Energy an attractive option for growth-seeking investors.

In conclusion, both Cameco and Centrus are well-positioned to benefit from the increasing reliance on nuclear energy by tech giants and governments, offering significant upside potential as AI and cloud computing continue to drive demand for reliable, sustainable power sources.",MSFT,yes,fmp,859

2024-10-18 05:45:00,3 Leading Tech Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/18/3-leading-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-2024-and-beyond/,"These technology companies are leading the pack and could continue to do so for years to come.

Recent artificial intelligence (AI) developments caused an influx of interest in tech stocks lately, mainly as investors are looking for the next big thing in the industry.

But betting it all on small tech companies that may or may not live up to the hype is a major risk. That's why it's important to give leading tech stocks serious consideration.

The companies below have been dominating their respective segments for years and will likely continue to so for many more years to come. Here's why they're worth buying right now.

Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%) is the undisputed AI semiconductor leader. Nvidia spent years gaining an increasingly large portion of the data center market with its graphics processing units (GPUs), as companies realized GPUs were better than central processing units (CPUs) for AI processing.

The release of OpenAI's ChatGPT was the starting gun for the AI race and now large tech companies can't buy Nvidia's GPUs fast enough as they try to secure hardware that will propel their tech over the next decade. The result is that Nvidia now has an estimated 70% to 95% of the artificial intelligence chip market.

That dominance sent Nvidia's stock into the stratosphere, with its share price rising 197% over the past year. Similar gains are unlikely if you buy in today, but continued growth is likely thanks to current enterprise spending habits.

Goldman Sachs estimates $1 trillion will be spent over the next four years as companies ramp up AI hardware, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes just $150 billion has been spent so far. Indeed, you don't have to dig far into Nvidia's finance to see the benefit from this. The company's data center sales soared 154% in the most recent quarter to $26.3 billion.

Buying Nvidia's stock right now means you'll pay a premium, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 35. But with its lead in the AI semiconductor market and companies falling over themselves to buy as many Nvidia chips as they can get, this tech leader is still a good long-term buy.

I know Apple (AAPL 0.36%) may not be at the forefront of some investors' minds, especially with so many more shiny new tech stocks out there. But there's something about a massively profitable tech giant that consistently moves into new markets and benefits (remember its move into services years ago?) that makes Apple deserving of a spot on this list.

And I think Apple is about to benefit from the pairing between AI software and the company's hardware through its Apple Intelligence features. The company's new AI will help users better keep track of their schedule, remember details from previous conversations, summarize and draft emails, and create images. Some features will also seamlessly work with ChatGPT.

Apple's AI will hit devices later this month and it could be a catalyst for the company's device sales. Estimates from research firm IDC say that generative AI smartphone shipments will spike 364% to 234 million this year -- and reach 912 million by 2028. With Apple's AI about to be released on its iPhones, it could end spurring an upgrade cycle for millions of iPhones users. Indeed, Counterpoint Research estimates 50 million iPhone 12 users could be champing at the bit for a new upgrade.

Skeptics will point to sluggish iPhone 16 demand since its release last month, but I suspect many potential customers are simply waiting to see Apple Intelligence out the wild before deciding to upgrade. With a forward P/E ratio of 30, Apple's stock isn't trading at a discount. But if you want a tech leader that's likely to continue benefiting from the billions of devices it has in people's hands for years to come, this tech juggernaut is still a buy.

Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%)has emerged as both a leading cloud computing player and AI first-mover. The company was one of the first established tech giants to see OpenAI's value and invested more than $13 billion to date in the AI start-up.

The early investment has proved to be a savvy move as ChatGPT became one of the most popular AI chatbots and Microsoft has implemented some of the software into its Microsoft 365 software products, its GitHub developer platform, and Azure cloud computing services.

Microsoft is already seeing the benefit from this, with the company's management saying on the fourth-quarter earnings call that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, up 60% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft holds 25% of the cloud computing market and its early implementation could help give the company an advantage as cloud computing reaches a $2 trillion market by 2030.

Microsoft's ability to see the benefits of AI, put money into OpenAI, and quickly integrate the tech will likely help the company maintain its software dominance for years to come. Even more importantly, integrating AI into its already well-established cloud services has already supercharged its services and will likely continue to do so.

Microsoft's stock trades at a forward P/E of 32 right now, making it a little pricey. But with the company already knee-deep in AI and cloud computing, investors can rest assured that this tech giant is well positioned for the future.",MSFT,yes,fmp,1073

2024-10-17 15:06:12,Microsoft said it lost weeks of security logs for its customers' cloud products,https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/microsoft-said-it-lost-weeks-of-security-logs-for-its-customers-cloud-products/,"Microsoft has notified customers that it’s missing more than two weeks of security logs for some of its cloud products, leaving network defenders without critical data for detecting possible intrusions.

According to a notification sent to affected customers, Microsoft said that “a bug in one of Microsoft’s internal monitoring agents resulted in a malfunction in some of the agents when uploading log data to our internal logging platform” between September 2 and September 19.

The notification said that the logging outage was not caused by a security incident, and “only affected the collection of log events.”

Business Insider first reported the loss of log data earlier in October. Details of the notification have not been widely reported. As noted by security researcher Kevin Beaumont, the notifications that Microsoft sent to affected companies are likely accessible only to a handful of users with tenant admin rights.

Logging helps to keep track of events within a product, such as information about users signing in and failed attempts, which can help network defenders identify suspected intrusions. Missing logs could make it more difficult to identify unauthorized access to the customers’ networks during that two-week window.

The affected products include Microsoft Entra, Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and Purview, according to the Business Insider report. Affected customers “may have experienced potential gaps in security related logs or events, possibly affecting customers’ ability to analyze data, detect threats, or generate security alerts,” the notification said.

Microsoft would not answer specific questions about the logging outage, but a Microsoft executive confirmed to TechCrunch that the incident was caused by an “operational bug within our internal monitoring agent.”

“We have mitigated the issue by rolling back a service change. We have communicated to all impacted customers and will provide support as needed,” said John Sheehan, a Microsoft corporate vice president.

The logging outage comes a year after Microsoft came under fire from federal investigators for withholding security logs from certain U.S. federal government departments that host their emails on the company’s hardened, government-only cloud; investigators said having access to those logs could have identified a series of China-backed intrusions far sooner.

The China-backed intruders, referred to as Storm-0558, broke into Microsoft’s network and stole a digital skeleton key that allowed the hackers unfettered access to U.S. government emails stored in Microsoft’s cloud. According to a government-issued postmortem of the cyberattack, the State Department identified the intrusions because it paid for a higher-tier Microsoft license that granted access to security logs for its cloud products, which many other hacked U.S. government agencies did not have.

Following the China-backed hacks, Microsoft said it would start providing logs to its lower-paid cloud accounts from September 2023.",MSFT,yes,fmp,541
2024-10-17 14:35:58,"Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and Gaming To Drive Low Double Digit Growth: Analyst",https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/10/41389192/microsoft-azure-office-365-and-gaming-to-drive-low-double-digit-growth-analyst,"Bank of America Securities analyst Bradley Sills reiterated a Buy rating on Microsoft Corp MSFT with a price target of $510.

Sills noted that Microsoft is well positioned to generate sustained low double-digit growth in the coming 3-5 years, led by continued adoption of the Azure cloud infrastructure platform, the cloud-based Office 365 productivity suite, and more profitable Games and Game Pass revenue in Xbox.

While a revenue mix shift toward lower-margin Azure and O365 segments is likely to offset scale benefits near-term, the analyst said operating expense scale will likely drive stable 50bps annual margin expansion over the coming years.

Also Read: Apple Pay Expands Buy Now, Pay Later With Affirm, Adds Support For Third-Party Browsers And More

Most Sills’ partners suggest solidly inline or better first-quarter fiscal 2025 results. As such, the analyst expects a 0%—1% upside to his first-quarter revenue estimate of $64.7 billion (+14% year-on-year, +11% year-on-year organic), driven by steady workload migration to Azure and upgrade momentum in the Office premium E3 and E5 cycle, somewhat offset by PC and Windows softness.

Sills’ commentary with partners suggests an inline migration of workloads to Azure, led by cloud migration and expanding AI. The analyst noted that security remained an area of strength.

He would look for upside Azure growth of 33%-34% year-on-year, under restated metrics (with 12% points from AI), versus his base of 33% (11%).

Sills’ estimate for M365 copilot revenue remains modest at $275 million. For More Personal Computing, he expects a largely inline result with his $12.5 billion estimate (+12% Y/Y).

The analyst flagged that the stock is +10.4% year-to-date, driven by enthusiasm for AI-led growth in Azure and Office. However, the shares have lagged recently due to concerns about ramping capex and limited visibility on the respective return on investment.

As per Sills, the stock is trading at 32 times the calendar year 2026 free cash flow, which is not stretched given the durability of low to mid-30s Azure growth, low mid-teens Office growth, and long-term scale on capex.

The analyst would look for multiple expansions as he approaches the expected second half of fiscal 2026 Azure reacceleration.

The price target of $510 is based on an EV/FCF multiple of 40 times calendar year 2026 FCF or 1.9 times adjusted for low 20s growth, a premium to the software GARP group at 1.5 times for durability of growth.

The artificial intelligence (AI) market is taking off, providing a significant tailwind for several growth-oriented companies. However, that doesn't mean income-seeking investors can't get in on the act. Several AI leaders, including Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, pay dividends. Which stock provides the best combination of AI-related growth and an attractive dividend program? In my view, the answer to that question is Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%). Read on to find out why.

Of the top tech companies benefiting from the rapid rise in AI, several don't pay dividends or have been doing so for less than three years. Amazon is in the former category, while Alphabet and Meta Platforms are in the latter.

That does not apply to Nvidia, but the chipmaker's dividend program isn't impressive. Its forward yield is 0.03%. In fairness, that's partly because the company's shares have been on fire lately, but investors can look at other things, including the fact that it isn't in the habit of raising its dividends every year. It recently hiked it significantly, so the total growth of its dividend per share over the past decade amounts to 370.6%.

However, Nvidia's quarterly dividend per share is a minuscule $0.01. How does Microsoft compare? It offers a much more attractive forward yield of 0.8%, raises its dividends regularly, and has increased its payouts by 167.7% in the past decade.

Microsoft's quarterly dividend per share of $0.83 is also far higher than those of its similarly sized tech peers, including Nvidia. Lastly, Microsoft's cash payout ratio is just under 30%, meaning the company has ample room to continue increasing its dividends. But can Microsoft's business support the payouts for a long time?

Microsoft played a role in the ongoing AI gold rush that started with ChatGPT. The tech giant invested in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, back in 2019. Following the chatbot's success, Microsoft doubled down and deepened its relationship with OpenAI. But that's only part of the company's involvement in this niche, and perhaps not the more important part. Microsoft offers a suite of AI-related services through Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing division.

With most companies now seeking at least some of these services, business is booming. In its latest period, the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2024 (ended June 30), Microsoft noted that Azure continues to be one of its fastest-growing segments. Microsoft's total revenue increased by 15% year over year to $64.7 billion. Azure's revenue was up 29% compared to the year-ago period. But how much did AI contribute to that performance? According to management, quite a bit.

Speaking of the cloud market and Azure in particular, CEO Satya Nadella said during the company's earnings conference call, ""Our share gains accelerated this year driven by AI."" This business should continue to provide a major tailwind for Microsoft since AI and cloud computing are both on a growth path. Although these likely represent the tech giant's biggest growth opportunities, there is more to its business. Microsoft remains the runaway leader in the computer operating systems market. It is also a leading player in gaming.

The company benefits from a solid moat from multiple sources. Consider the switching costs associated with its suite of productivity tools (Excel, Word, Teams, etc.). Businesses that rely on these products won't easily jump ship for fear of disrupting their day-to-day activities. Microsoft also carries one of the most valuable brand names in the world, another potent competitive edge.

Microsoft is an innovative company that generates plenty of cash flow and boasts a robust balance sheet, as its AAA rating from Standard & Poor's -- a higher rating than the U.S. government -- confirms.

2024-10-17 05:23:00,Every Microsoft Stock Investor Should Watch This Key Number On Oct. 30,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/17/every-microsoft-stock-investor-key-number-oct-30/,"Investors are about to get a fresh look at Microsoft's artificial intelligence progress.

Corporate America is heading into another important earnings season. Wall Street will be especially focused on results from the technology giants that dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) race because they tend to deliver much stronger revenue and earnings growth than the rest of the stock market.

Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) is scheduled to release the results for its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended Sept. 30) on Oct. 30, and investors will be keenly focused on how well it is monetizing its growing portfolio of AI products and services.

However, there will be one AI number in Microsoft's report that could be more important than the rest.

Microsoft's numerous AI projects will be under the microscope

Early last year, Microsoft rocked the tech sector by announcing plans to invest another $10 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It has since used OpenAI's industry-leading models to create several AI products, including its Copilot virtual assistants, which are capable of generating text, images, and even computer code in response to simple prompts.

Copilot is now embedded for free in most of Microsoft's flagship software, including the Windows operating system, the Edge internet browser, and the Bing search engine. However, the company charges an additional monthly subscription to add Copilot to its Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which includes Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

Companies worldwide pay for more than 400 million 365 seats, and all of them are potential candidates for Copilot add-ons, which presents a significant financial opportunity for Microsoft. During its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (which ended June 30), Microsoft said the number of corporate customers that bought more than 10,000 Copilot add-ons for 365 had doubled from just three months earlier. Investors should look for updates on Copilot numbers in the upcoming quarter.

But the Azure cloud computing platform will likely headline the report, thanks mainly to Azure AI. That's the offering that allows businesses and developers to rent data center computing capacity powered by the latest chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, in order to build their own AI models. Azure AI also offers access to the latest large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4o from OpenAI, which developers can use to accelerate the creation of AI software applications like chatbots and virtual assistants. At the end of Q4, Azure AI had 60,000 customers which was an impressive 60% increase from a year earlier.

The big number that Microsoft investors need to watch

The Azure cloud platform has consistently been the fastest-growing part of Microsoft's entire organization, which is why investors tend to focus on it the most. During Q4, Azure revenue increased 29% year over year, which marked an acceleration from 26% in the prior-year quarter.

Azure's growth is increasingly driven by Azure AI. For example, Azure AI was responsible for 8 percentage points of Azure's overall 29% growth during Q4, which was a record high. That represented a whopping eightfold increase from the year-ago quarter, when Azure AI contributed just 1 percentage point to the company's top-line growth rate.

Microsoft spent a whopping $55.7 billion on capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024, most of which went toward AI data center infrastructure and chips. Management has already said it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025.

The revenue generated by Azure AI is one way to measure the payoffs Microsoft (and its investors) are receiving for those significant financial outlays. Suppose Azure AI continues to contribute an increasing share of growth to Azure. That will indicate that businesses and developers are spending money on computing capacity and access to the latest LLMs.

Based on Microsoft's trailing 12-month earnings per share of $11.80, its stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35.5. That's a 10.5% premium to the 32.1 ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, which includes all of Microsoft's big-tech peers.

The sheer amount of money Microsoft is spending on AI infrastructure will be a headwind for its earnings for at least the next year. Therefore, if Azure AI continues to make a growing contribution to the Azure cloud platform's results, investors will likely be more comfortable with continuing to support the stock's premium valuation. However, if Azure AI stalls or underwhelms, that could trigger a correction in Microsoft stock.

That's why, in my opinion, Azure AI's contribution to Azure's overall revenue growth is the number investors should be watching on Oct. 30.",MSFT,yes,fmp,942
2024-10-17 04:15:00,"Microsoft Is Spending Big on Artificial Intelligence, but Will It Pay Off?",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/17/microsoft-is-spending-big-on-artificial-intelligen/,"Microsoft's capital expenditures have grown by nearly 300% in the past five years.

A big growth opportunity in tech these days is undoubtedly in artificial intelligence (AI). The entire AI market could be worth more than $1.8 trillion by the end of the decade, according to estimates from Grand View Research. That translates into a compound annual growth rate of 36.6%. For tech companies, that mouthwatering level of growth is what helps justify spending heavily on new technologies.

But there's also going to be no shortage of competition in the space. And the announcement that ChatGPT maker OpenAI will incur around $5 billion in losses this year despite generating $3.7 billion in revenue underscores how challenging it may be to turn a profit on AI, especially in the short term.

One company that's investing heavily into AI these days is Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%). Not only has it invested in OpenAI, but it's also spending money on enhancing its products and services with AI capabilities. How big of a payoff that will have on its bottom line, however, is certainly debatable.

Microsoft's capex spending has been through the roof in recent years

Capital expenditures (capex) are what a company spends to add, upgrade, or maintain its assets, for the purpose of growing the business in the long run. It's a discretionary expense and when there's a big growth opportunity, spending can ramp up significantly. In the past five years, Microsoft's capital spending has increased at a far quicker rate than revenue.

This isn't necessarily a cause for concern simply because the goal of increased capital expenditures is greater revenue growth down the road.

The big test will be if this high level of spend leads to an acceleration of Microsoft's growth.

Spending on AI for the sake of investing in AI won't necessarily pay off

Microsoft has the resources necessary to invest in AI, but throwing a lot of money at something doesn't mean that it's going to pay off for the business in the future. There are a growing number of AI-powered products and services in the market these days, and Microsoft will need to prove that it has superior products for that to lead to strong revenue growth.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff compares Microsoft's new Copilot AI to the much maligned Clippy of years past. Microsoft recently rolled out an updated version of Copilot, but if it doesn't impress business users and help justify its $30/month per user price tag for Microsoft 365, the investments the company is making in AI may not end up being worthwhile.

Should you invest in Microsoft's stock?

Shares of Microsoft are up a fairly modest 12% this year (the S&P 500 has risen by 23%) as investors may be growing apprehensive about the stock's valuation and whether AI will be the catalyst the company expects. At 36 times earnings, the tech stock is a bit pricey and its $3.1 trillion valuation means it's one of the most valuable companies in the world.

If you're investing for the long run and willing to hold on for years, then Microsoft can still make for a solid buy. Its dominance of office software products, popular Windows operating system, and expansion into gaming are all reasons why the company can continue to do well for the foreseeable future. The one wrinkle, however, is that without a high growth rate, investors may be hesitant to pay a big premium for the stock. And lackluster growth from AI could exacerbate those concerns.

I expect the company will eventually figure out what works and what doesn't with respect to AI. Microsoft can afford to make mistakes and experiment along the way. And that's why in the short run, if it underwhelms the market with its Copilot AI, it might struggle, but over the long haul the stock is still likely to rise in value.",MSFT,yes,fmp,781

• Amazon is anchoring a $500 million financing round for X-energy to develop modular nuclear reactors.
• The first sites in Washington and Virginia would provide carbon-free energy to meet growing demand.
• Amazon's announcement follows investments in nuclear energy from Microsoft and Google amid the AI boom.

Big Tech continues to go nuclear as the artificial-intelligence boom drives energy demand to new heights.

Amazon announced on Wednesday that it's anchoring a $500 million investment for X-energy to develop small, advanced modular nuclear reactors, which would provide carbon-free power for some of its data centers.

Amazon Web Services, which provides cloud services to clients, including generative-AI products, relies on large data centers that require huge amounts of energy to operate.

Citadel's founder and CEO, Ken Griffin, as well as affiliates of Ares Management Corp., NGP, and the University of Michigan, are among the investors in the Series C-1 financing round.

""We need smart solutions that can help us meet growing energy demands while also addressing climate change,"" Amazon's vice president of global data centers, Kevin Miller, said in a statement. ""X-energy's technology will be integral in helping achieve this, and is an important step in Amazon's work to achieve our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero by 2040.""

The companies said their partnership aimed to develop more than 5 gigawatts of new power projects across the US by 2039.

The first sites in Washington and Virginia would provide carbon-free energy to meet growing demand through partnerships with Energy Northwest and Dominion Energy, respectively.

Using clusters of 80-megawatt reactors, the first installation in Washington would begin with four units generating 320 megawatts of power, with the option to scale up to 12 units that deliver 960 megawatts. The highest carbon-emitting coal-powered plants generate roughly 2,000 to 4,000 megawatts, according to Politico's E&E News.

Amazon's investment follows similar interest in nuclear from Microsoft and Google as the tech giants seek out clean energy to fuel foundation AI development for large language models, which require massive amounts of energy.

Microsoft last month helped advance a plan to reopen the Three Mile Island plant, the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in US history, and Google on Monday announced a partnership in small-modular-reactor tech with Kairos Power.

Earlier this year, Amazon bought a $650 million data center in Pennsylvania that came with a direct line to the nearby nuclear-powered Susquehanna Steam Electric Station.

Other proposals in New Jersey, Ohio, and Texas would build data centers adjacent to nuclear plants to bypass the power grid, IEEE Spectrum reported.

In contrast to a full-scale nuclear facility, X-energy says its modular system is ""road-shippable"" and can be installed where it is needed.

""Nuclear is an important source of clean and reliable power that our nation needs to meet the growing demand for energy,"" Griffin said in a statement. ""X-energy provides an impactful solution to a critical challenge — and the support Amazon, Dow, and other major corporations have provided underscores its potential and merit.""",MSFT,yes,fmp,631

2024-10-25T14:10:00+00:00,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella asked for a pay cut — but he still made more than before,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-asked-125000037.html,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella asked for a pay cut — but he still made more than before

Microsoft (MSFT) chief executive Satya Nadella got a 63% pay bump in the last fiscal year thanks to the company’s blowout financial performance. He could have netted millions more had it not been for a number of cybersecurity breaches at the tech giant.



Given Microsoft’s strong performance during the fiscal year ending June 30, Nadella received a total of $79.1 million for the fiscal year that ended June 30, up from $48.5 million in 2023, Microsoft disclosed in a regulatory filing Thursday.

That’s mainly comprised of stock awards worth $50 million. Nadella also received a cash incentive of $5.2 million — less than half what he would have received based solely on the company’s financial and operational performance for the fiscal year.

“Mr. Nadella agreed that the Company’s performance was extremely strong, but reflecting on his personal commitment to security and his role as the CEO, asked the Board to consider departing from the established performance metrics and reduce his cash incentive to reflect his personal accountability for the focus and speed required for the changes that today’s cybersecurity threat landscape showed were necessary,” the compensation committee wrote in a letter to shareholders.

Microsoft was the target of a series of major cyberattack campaigns in 2023 and early 2024. In April, the U.S. Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) found that Chinese hackers known as Storm-558 compromised the Microsoft Exchange Online emails of 22 organizations and more than 500 people around the world, including senior U.S. government officials working on national security.

The report, released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), found the attack was “preventable,” and that a series of Microsoft’s operational and strategy decisions led to “a corporate culture that deprioritized enterprise security investments and rigorous risk management.”

In January of this year, Microsoft’s corporate email systems were attacked by Midnight Blizzard, a Russian state-sponsored actor. The company said in March it could see evidence of the hackers using stolen information to gain access to its “source code repositories and internal systems.” Microsoft said it hadn’t seen evidence its customer-facing systems were compromised.

For the 2025 fiscal year, the committee said added a new performance category based on cybersecurity accountability. It also enhanced its executive compensation program to reflect leadership’s focus on the company’s AI goals.

Over 95% of Nadella’s compensation is performance-based, and typically 70% of the annual cash incentive is tied to achieving pre-established financial targets. Last year, Microsoft shareholder returns totaled 32%, which meant Nadella was eligible for a more than 138% payout as a percentage of the company’s target.

As Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) build on their artificial intelligence ambitions, the tech giants are also entering the race for alternative energy to meet AI’s massive consumption of power.

Microsoft announced a 20-year power purchase agreement in September with Constellation Energy (CEG) — the owner of most of the country’s power plants — that will restart the Unit 1 nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island.

In 2015, the company’s billionaire co-founder Bill Gates launched his investment firm, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, to invest in sustainable energy companies and other technologies.

Here are six energy-focused companies Gates and Breakthrough Energy have invested in.

Breakthrough Energy invested in Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ $115 million Series A funding round in June 2019, according to PitchBook. The investment firm was a follow-on investor in the company’s $84 million Series A2 round in May 2020, and its $1.8 billion Series B funding round in December 2021, which also counted Gates as an investor, according to PitchBook.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems, the largest commercial fusion energy company in the world, uses high-temperature superconducting magnets to build tokamak fusion systems, which are small and low-cost.

The company is currently working with MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center on a fusion device called SPARC, which can produce “plasmas which generate more energy than they consume, becoming the first net-energy fusion machine.”

After SPARC, CFS said it will build ARC, “the world’s first fusion power plant capable of producing net electricity.”

Gates was the lead partner in Breakthrough Energy’s investment in KoBold Metals’ $5 million Series A funding round in March 2019, which valued the company at $12.5 million, according to PitchBook.

KoBold uses AI to find deposits of high-demand metals, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, that can be used in the production of renewable energy products like solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. The company has over 60 projects on four continents.

Breakthrough Energy also invested in the company’s $200.8 million Series B funding round in February 2022, leading to a $517.83 million valuation, and in another Series B round in March 2023 where it raised $195 million, and was valued at $1 billion. Gates was listed as an investor in this Series B funding round on PitchBook.

In January 2018, Gates invested in Mainspring Energy’s $83.3 million Series C, according to PitchBook, which led the company to a $208.3 million valuation.

Mainspring’s linear generator uses chemical energy to convert motion along a linear line into clean electricity at any scale, according to the company. The linear generator continuously adjusts compression and expansion to different fuel quality and fuels, so it can use fuels such as biogas and green hydrogen.

The linear generators can match power output with demand, and integrate on-site solar and energy storage. The technology can also continue providing power if an energy grid is down.

Gates was a follow-on investor in Mainspring’s $108.1 million Series D funding round, according to PitchBook, which led the company to a $458.1 million valuation in May 2021.

He invested again in Mainspring’s $290 million Series E funding round in September 2022, which led the company to a $1.04 billion valuation, according to PitchBook.

Gates and Breakthrough Energy are listed as investors in Fervo Energy’s $11 million Series A funding round in July 2019, according to PitchBook, which valued the company at $25 million.

Fervo Energy uses “precision directional drilling technology to drill horizontally in geothermal reservoirs,” so it can drill multiple wells for geothermal energy with a lower surface footprint. The company says geothermal technology, which uses hot water to produce electricity, is the “ideal” source to meet growing demand for 24/7 carbon-free electricity. Geothermal is also ideal to complement solar and wind energy, according to the company.

Breakthrough Energy was a follow-on investor in the company’s $28 million Series B funding round in April 2021, which valued it at $70 million, according to PitchBook, and invested again in its $138.2 million Series C in August 2022, which led to a $308.2 million valuation. Gates was also an investor in Fervo Energy’s $244 million Series D funding round in February, according to PitchBook. The Series D led the company to a $640 million valuation.

Gates invested in Seaborg Technologies’ $6 million seed funding round in April 2018, according to PitchBook.

The Danish company developed an alternative to conventional nuclear reactors called a Compact Molten Salt Reactor (CMSR). The CMSR has fuel mixed with a liquid salt coolant, whereas conventional nuclear reactors use solid fuel rods that are usually constantly cooled by water under high pressure.

Mixing fuel with the liquid salt “ensures it can always be cooled and it cannot melt down or explode,” the company said. Instead, the CMSR can shut itself down in case of an emergency.

Seaborg also developed floating power plants called Power Barges that it will deploy the CMSRs on. The Power Barges can produce between 200MW and 800MW of electricity, according to the company.

Gates’s Breakthrough Energy is listed as an investor in Koloma’s $55.7 million Series A funding round in August 2022, which valued the company at $203.7 million, according to PitchBook.

The “geologic hydrogen company” uses technology to “source hydrogen in a clean, continuous, and cost-effective manner.” Geologic hydrogen comes from iron-rich source rocks, Koloma said, which are cleaner than carbon-rich mature and organic source rocks.

Breakthrough Energy and Gates are both listed as investors in the company’s $247.74 million Series B funding round in October, according to PitchBook, which led to an $845.74 million valuation.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been around since the late 19th century. Its storied past has made it one of the key benchmarks that investors turn to for gauging stock market performance.

The 30 components in the Dow have changed a lot in recent years, with the addition of Amazon, Salesforce, and other growth names. Still, the Dow acts as a great representative of the broader market. And with all but two components paying dividends (Amazon and Boeing), the Dow is a great starting point for discovering blue chip dividend stocks.

Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) and Walt Disney (DIS -0.39%) have been components of the Dow since the 1990s, while Nike (NKE -0.24%) was added in 2013. Here's why all three Dow stocks are balanced buys worth considering through 2025.

Microsoft will report its fiscal 2025's first-quarter earnings on Oct. 30. Investors will likely be watching for sustained growth in its Intelligent Cloud, artificial intelligence (AI) product improvements, engagement with Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot, guidance for fiscal 2025, and the company's capital expenditure (capex) plans.

The company has been growing capex faster than revenue as it ramps up AI spending -- and there are concerns that spending may not pay off as much as investors hope, which could pressure the stock price. But management has lots of advantages over smaller companies. For starters, it has more cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities than debt on its balance sheet. Strong financial health gives Microsoft the wiggle room to pounce on exciting opportunities.

Microsoft also generates so much profit that it can afford these aggressive spending plans and still have plenty of cash left over to buy back a ton of its own stock and pay a rapidly growing dividend. In September, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.83 per share and authorized a new $60 billion share repurchase program.

Over the past decade, the company has increased its dividend by 168% and reduced its share count by nearly 10% -- which is impressive considering its high stock-based compensation expense.

Microsoft is a balanced tech stock with a multi-decade runway for continued growth, helping to justify its current price-to-earnings ratio of 35.4. It's a top Dow stock to watch through 2025 and could be an incredibly compelling buy if Wall Street beats its stock price down over short-term concerns.

Nike has a lot of work to do

There's no sugarcoating how bad Nike stock has been in 2024: down over 23% compared to big gains in the major indexes. It is within 20% of a five-year low and is bringing in a new CEO to turn the business around.

Like many companies, Nike is dealing with a slowdown in China. But what's particularly concerning is that lower sales and profitability have spread throughout the business, including footwear and apparel across all regions. Total Nike brand sales for the three months ended Aug. 31 were down 10% compared to the same period last year. And that same period in 2023 wasn't even that impressive of a quarter.

Nike's problems certainly aren't trivial, but they do seem solvable. And when top brands go on sale for challenges that can prove temporary, it's often a phenomenal time to buy the stock.

The main issues are that it mismanaged customer demand and was hit hard by supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. The build-out of Nike Direct, its e-commerce platform, was meant to help it be less dependent on wholesale and engage directly with consumers. But even Nike Direct is struggling, with sales down 13% in the recent quarter.

At just 23.9 times earnings and with a dividend yield of 1.8%, Nike stock stands out as a compelling value and a decent source of passive income in an otherwise expensive market. However, investors should only consider the stock if they are willing to give the company time to turn things around, as the situation could worsen before it gets better.

Disney is another Dow component that has been a major disappointment for patient investors. The stock is up less than 25% from its 10-year low and is on track to underperform the S&P 500 for the fourth consecutive year. But things are finally looking up for the media and entertainment giant.

Its streaming service, Disney+, is finally profitable. The company is back to generating box office hits, most notably Inside Out 2, which was a smashing success.

Management is paying a dividend and buying back stock again -- a sign it isn't as strapped for cash as it was a couple of years ago when Disney+ was bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars each quarter in operating losses.

Still, Disney is a highly cyclical company that depends on consumer discretionary spending. When household budgets get cut, a Disney trip is likely top of the list. After years of price increases, it just hiked theme park prices again, which could lead to disgruntled customers and hurt demand.

The company is not at the top of its game, but the worst of its box office blues and streaming slog are over. As with Nike, buying Disney now is more of a bet on where it could be years from now than where it is today. It stands out as a top value stock for patient investors to buy now.",MSFT,yes,eod,1113
2024-10-22T00:00:00+00:00,"Got $1,000 to Invest? This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Is a Great Option Heading Into 2025",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/22/got-1000-to-invest-this-magnificent-seven-stock-is/,"The wide range of products and services Microsoft offers means its business faces fewer risks than other big tech companies.

The ""Magnificent Seven"" is a name given to a group of the world's largest and most promising tech companies. Its members are Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%), Apple (AAPL 0.36%), Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%), Alphabet (GOOG 1.50%) (GOOGL 1.57%), Amazon (AMZN 0.78%), Meta (META 0.96%), and Tesla (TSLA 3.34%). Of those, Tesla is the smallest, with a market cap of about $700 billion. Needless to say, these are powerhouse companies.

There are great cases for investing in all of the Magnificent Seven companies, but Microsoft is the one I'm most excited about now. If you have $1,000 to invest (meaning you already have an emergency fund set aside and your high-interest debt is paid down), it could become a staple of your portfolio.

I like Microsoft going into 2025 because its business is much more diversified than the other Magnificent Seven companies. Its success -- or lack thereof -- won't rely on a specific product or service. For perspective, here are products or services that will determine a lot about how the other Magnificent Seven stocks fare:
• Apple: As the iPhone goes, so does Apple. When iPhone sales are great, Apple's revenue growth is great; when they're down, it weighs heavily on Apple's revenue.
• Nvidia: Nvidia's success will be tied to the sales of its graphic processing units, which have become vital to the artificial intelligence pipeline.
• Alphabet: Advertising on Google Search is the backbone of Alphabet. Any slowdowns or disruptions to the advertising business will have tangible effects on its bottom line.
• Amazon: E-commerce is Amazon's bread and butter. Amazon Web Services brings in the most profit, but e-commerce generates the revenue Amazon relies on to fund its other ventures.
• Meta: Advertising provided more than 98% of Meta's revenue in its latest quarter. Any slowdown in the digital ad business will stall the company's financial growth.
• Tesla: If Tesla can't scale its electric vehicle production and hold onto its lead in the industry, the company faces a major uphill battle.

This isn't a knock on any of the above businesses. I'm a strong believer in most of them. More than anything, it highlights how wide Microsoft has cast its business web.

Microsoft has enterprise software, consumer software, cloud services, gaming, social media, and hardware products, and it's not overly dependent on any of them. Its largest business segment, Intelligent Cloud, only accounts for about 44% of its revenue.

You can't argue against Microsoft's financials

Microsoft's strong financial performance in recent years is undeniable. In its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), its revenue and operating income both increased 15% year over year to $64.7 billion and $27.9 billion, respectively.

It has also doubled its operating income (profit from core operations) during the past five years -- a great feat for a company of its size. It's a testament to its operational efficiency and growth of high-margin businesses like its cloud platform, Azure.

Cloud computing will continue to be a high-growth area for Microsoft in the near future. Even if it doesn't grow at the pace it has during the past few years (although it should), it will still provide a nice boost to Microsoft's financials.

It's not cheap, but it's worth it for long-term investors

Admittedly, Microsoft is priced at a premium, though that has been the case for a while. The shares trade at about 31.6 times forward earnings, significantly higher than the S&P 500's average of 22.8. But rarely do world-class companies with as much attention as Microsoft trade at a bargain level, so it's not too surprising.

Anytime you invest in a stock that's priced at a premium, you run the risk of limiting your near-term upside potential. Luckily, Microsoft has committed to returning shareholder value via dividends and stock buybacks.

Its $0.83 quarterly dividend gives it a yield of about 0.8% at the recent share price, but Microsoft has consistently increased its payouts through the years. Investors will also appreciate Microsoft's recently announced $60 billion stock buyback program.

If you're looking for an undervalued company or a true income stock, Microsoft likely won't be your go-to pick. However, if you're in it for the long haul, Microsoft is a stock you could feel comfortable buying and holding on to without too much concern about its current valuation.",MSFT,yes,eod,966

While NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) are “the core drivers of AI, now we are seeing many other tech stalwarts join the AI Party,” Ives wrote, listing Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR), Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) among the companies making significant moves in artificial intelligence.

The analyst expressed optimism about the technology sector’s near-term prospects, stating, “We believe the next phase of the AI Revolution has begun.” He expects this momentum, combined with strengthening enterprise spending and a recovery in digital advertising, to push technology stocks higher through the end of the year.

This expanding AI landscape indicates a broader range of investment opportunities beyond the few companies that initially dominated the AI narrative earlier in the year, according to Ives.

There are some top AI stocks that are seeing insider selling activity. In this article, we take a look at those stocks and analyze their fundamentals and market sentiment. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

On September 9, 2024, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Vice Chair and President Bradford L. Smith sold 40,000 shares at $402.59 per share, reducing his ownership by 7% to 532,347 shares. The sale was valued at approximately $16.1 million. The stock is up about 3% since the transaction.

DA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum. Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria.

Following a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA. Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins. The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities. The concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Insiders are Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-10-21T14:07:39+00:00,Microsoft pledges to end ‘civil service drudgery’ with admin bots,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-pledges-end-civil-drudgery-140739278.html,"Civil servants are to be given new AI tools to help them do their jobs under a partnership that Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has said will end the “drudgery” of Whitehall work.

Microsoft on Monday unveiled new “autonomous agents” – akin to a digital secretary or virtual coworker – that can automatically respond to emails, handle administrative tasks and organise schedules.

It came as the company announced a five-year deal with the British government to provide the tools to Whitehall.

The “autonomous agents” rely on Microsoft’s Copilot AI technology. AI bots can be built that perform simple business functions such as monitoring and responding to emails, reviewing documents and acting as a “personal concierge” for customer service.

The Whitehall deal gives public sector organisations access to Microsoft’s Copilot automation tools, although not its latest “autonomous agents” product.

Mr Nadella said “putting [AI] in the hands of civil servants” would help with “reducing the drudgery and improving productivity” and improve the “services that the Government offers, whether it is in health, whether it is in education, whether it is in energy or any sector of the Government”.

The Tony Blair Institute, a think tank run by the former Labour prime minister, earlier this year estimated that AI could improve public sector productivity by £40bn a year.

The Government has been looking at ways to use the technology in order to save money and stop public sector spending spiralling further out of control. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, is facing a £40bn black hole in public finances that she has blamed on the Tories.

Last week, Sir Keir claimed AI could be a “game changer” for the Government, while Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, has said AI could be used to revolutionise cancer care and drug development.

The Government has launched a review of the technology and announced an AI Opportunities Unit to spearhead adoption.

Mr Nadella said the new tools would help with “reducing the drudgery and improving productivity”.

Microsoft’s increasingly advanced AI software will be able to retrieve information from across organisations and automatically draft presentations for meetings.

Already, Microsoft’s AI tools can be used to transcribe and summarise meeting notes and email these to executives. But its revamped bots will be able to function autonomously and undertake more complex tasks such as managing a diary or handling sales or customer interactions, only falling back on a human as a last resort.

The new tools follow a groundswell of interest in AI tools from businesses following the launch of ChatGPT, which was developed by Silicon Valley start-up OpenAI two years ago. Shares in technology giants involved in AI have soared on the belief these tools are set to transform the world of work.

Microsoft, a $3 trillion (£2.3 trillion) technology giant, has invested billions of pounds in AI technology, including a multibillion-dollar stake in OpenAI. Mr Nadella said the impact of the tools on Microsoft had been “tremendous”, with the company closing 20pc more deals in teams that have used its Copilot tools. AI assistants have been rolled out across sales and marketing, customer service, legal, HR and IT. The Whitehall deal comes days after Clare Barclay, Microsoft’s UK chief executive, was appointed to lead the Government’s new Industrial Strategy Advisory Council. Mr Nadella said the tie-up would ensure the “diffusion of tech happens not just in the private sector, but also across the public sector”. Ms Barclay said the deal would help “transform public services and fuel the UK’s economic growth”. Technology giants have promised AI will help boost jobs by cutting down on tedious tasks while freeing people up to more of the productive work that drives growth. However, the latest innovations will reignite fears that bots could replace traditional office jobs, such as secretarial work or customer service roles. In the 1950s, 1.5m women worked in secretarial roles in the UK, but the advent of personal computers put an end to typing pools and shorthand. Today, around 1.5m people work in “administrative support services” – jobs likely to be transformed by the advent of AI bots. One customer case study, cited by Microsoft in its announcement, claimed using Copilot was equivalent to hiring 187 full time staff. Chatbots have increasingly been used by businesses to speed up email-writing, for presentations, customer interactions or technical functions such as coding. However, the technology has also attracted scepticism, with AI bots known to make mistakes or occasionally invent information. Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, which competes with Microsoft, last week said its rival’s Copilot technology was “more like Clippy 2.0”, a reference to a rudimentary bot developed by Microsoft in the 1990s for Word.",MSFT,yes,eod,985

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 190% in five years.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.

See our latest analysis for Microsoft

There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.

During five years of share price growth, Microsoft achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 18% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 24% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.

The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).

We know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Microsoft will grow revenue in the future.

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Microsoft's TSR for the last 5 years was 204%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!

Microsoft provided a TSR of 28% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 25% per year over five year. This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Microsoft better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Microsoft you should be aware of.

2024-10-21T11:54:46+00:00,Microsoft deploys AI bots to free workers from routine tasks,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ai-bots-worker-admin-115446617.html,"Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft (MSFT), has compared the transformative potential of AI with the industrial revolution, as the company launched new tools designed to help businesses streamline operations.

Speaking at Microsoft's AI Tour event in London, Nadella said the goal is to “empower people to do things that they couldn’t do previously.”

One of the leading investors in AI, Microsoft announced the rollout of its Copilot AI features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. These AI tools, known as autonomous agents, are custom-built applications that can handle specific tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more strategic work.

During the event, Microsoft showcased examples of how Copilot is already being used in business processes. Consultancy firm McKinsey & Company, for instance, is using Copilot to automate responses to client requests. The AI-powered tool extracts key information from emails, such as the client’s name, company, and the nature of the proposal. It then cross-references it with relevant data and forwards the details to the appropriate expert. McKinsey estimates that the tool could reduce the time partners spend managing client engagements by 30%.

These autonomous agents can be built with Microsoft’s Copilot Studio using low-code or no-code instructions, allowing users to create AI-driven workflows without requiring extensive technical expertise.

For example, businesses can instruct an agent to sort and process incoming emails and specify how the AI should respond to missing or incomplete information. Employees can also oversee the AI's work to ensure accuracy and correct any errors, known as ""hallucinations.""

Microsoft’s broader AI strategy is closely tied to its significant investments in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. The tech company envisions a future where AI-powered agents are found everywhere in the workplace, functioning autonomously or responding to user prompts. Nadella described these agents as the ""new apps for an AI-powered world.""

William Hewish, UK-based Pets at Home (PETS.L) CIO, said AI has helped staff focus on more complex tasks by handling time-consuming data collection. The company’s profit protection team, for instance, uses AI to assess potential profit loss cases more efficiently, allowing them to focus on skilled analysis rather than basic information gathering.

The new software will be available for public preview next month.

The announcement comes only weeks after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticised Microsoft’s Copilot, likening it to the infamous Clippy assistant from the 1990s and claiming it fails to deliver meaningful value. “It doesn’t work,” Benioff said, adding that Salesforce’s (CRM) own AI tool, Agentforce, can handle trillions of transactions per week and offers a more impactful solution for businesses. Microsoft, which has consistently ranked among the world’s most valuable companies, is locked in a race with Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) to become the first company to reach a $4tn market capitalisation. Since Nadella took over as CEO, Microsoft’s stock price has more than doubled, driven by a shift in focus toward cloud computing, cross-platform technologies, AI, and emerging fields such as quantum computing. Nadella has moved the company away from its former reliance on Windows, scrapping its failed mobile phone division and pushing into new technologies that he hopes will define the future of computing.

The company announced that users can now build their own autonomous agents in Copilot Studio that can “understand the nature of your work and act on your behalf.” Microsoft customers will be able to create their own autonomous agents in public preview in November, the company announced during its AI Tour in London.

AI agents range from simple prompt-and-response to being fully autonomous, meaning they can “work on behalf of an individual, team, or function” on business processes, Microsoft said. Users will be able to interact with the autonomous agents through Copilot.

The company also announced 10 new autonomous agents for its enterprise platform, Dynamics 365. The new agents are designed for workers in “sales, service, finance, and supply chain,” but the company plans to develop more agents, it said. The 10 autonomous agents will become available for public preview later this year and into early 2025, according to Microsoft.

Microsoft said its Copilot Studio autonomous agents will use OpenAI’s new “reasoning” model, o1 — which is in preview — as well as other new AI models “to boost their AI and reasoning abilities.”

“These models offer more precise predictions, enhanced natural language processing, and improved decision-making support,” Microsoft said.

In July, Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang said the next wave of AI is in the enterprise, where everyone at a company “will have an AI assistant.”

“We hope that we can give every single organization the ability to create their own AIs,” Huang said during a fireside chat at SIGGRAPH, a computer graphics conference. “So everybody would be augmented and have a collaborative AI that could empower them, help them do better work.”

AI agents are smaller, more focused versions of AI assistants which can be programmed to carry out a single task or have a specific area of focus, which can operate autonomously.

Earlier this year, Microsoft announced it was introducing the ability to create agents within its Copilot AI assistant, and the tech giant has now confirmed these tools will enter public preview next month inside its Copilot Studio tool.

In addition, the firm said it was introducing a group of 10 pre-made autonomous agents that can help “every sales, service, finance and supply chain team drive business value”.

The agents can be trained on an individual business’ own records and data in order to help it provide the relevant support.

Jared Spataro, chief marketing officer for AI at work at Microsoft, said: “Copilot is your AI assistant— it works for you — and Copilot Studio enables you to easily create, manage and connect agents to Copilot.

“Think of agents as the new apps for an AI-powered world. Every organisation will have a constellation of agents — ranging from simple prompt-and-response to fully autonomous.

“They will work on behalf of an individual, team or function to execute and orchestrate businesses process.

“Copilot is how you’ll interact with these agents, and they’ll do everything from accelerating lead generation and processing sales orders to automating your supply chain.”

Microsoft said more than half of Fortune 500 companies in the United States were already using Copilot tools within their business.

The recent boom in the technology has seen many of the world’s major technology firms begin rolling out AI-powered tools for users, as they jostle for key positions in the emerging market.

Some critics have raised concerns about the potential for AI tools and automation to disrupt the jobs market, but Microsoft says it has positioned its tools as assistants to work alongside humans, rather than as potential replacements.

“New autonomous agents enable customers to move from legacy lines of business applications to AI-first business process,” Mr Spataro said.

“These new agents are designed to help every sales, service, finance and supply chain team drive business value — and are just the start.

“We will create many more agents in the coming year that will give customers the competitive advantage they need to future-proof their organisation.”",MSFT,yes,eod,486
2024-10-21T09:34:31+00:00,Microsoft to let clients build AI agents for routine tasks from November,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-allow-autonomous-ai-agent-093431940.html,"(Reuters) -Microsoft will allow its customers to build autonomous artificial intelligence agents from next month, in its latest push to tap the booming technology amid growing investor scrutiny of its hefty AI investments.

The company is positioning autonomous agents - programs that need little human intervention unlike chatbots - as ""apps for an AI-driven world"" that can handle client queries, identify sales leads and manage inventory.

Other big technology companies such as Salesforce have also touted the potential of such agents, tools that some analysts say could provide companies with an easier path to monetizing the billions of dollars they are pouring into AI.

Microsoft said its customers can use Copilot Studio - an application that requires little knowledge of computer code - to create such agents in public preview from November. It is using several AI models developed in-house and by OpenAI for the agents.

The company is also introducing 10 ready-for-use agents that can help with routine tasks ranging from managing supply chain to expense tracking and client communications.

In a demo, McKinsey & Co, which had early access to the tools, created an agent that can manage client inquires by checking interaction history, identifying the consultant for the task and scheduling a follow-up meeting.

""The idea is that Copilot (the company's chatbot) is the user interface for AI,"" Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot at Microsoft, told Reuters.

""Every employee will have a Copilot, their personalized AI agent, and then they will use that Copilot to interface and interact with the sea of AI agents that will be out there.""

Tech giants are facing pressure to show returns on their big AI investments. Microsoft's shares fell 2.8% in the September quarter, underperforming the S&P 500, but remain more than 10% higher for the year.

Some concerns have risen in recent months about the pace of Copilot adoption, with research firm Gartner saying in August its survey of 152 IT organizations showed the vast majority had not progressed their Copilot initiatives past the pilot stage.",MSFT,yes,eod,410
2024-10-21T09:30:44+00:00,Microsoft launches Copilot AI features as investors look for signs artificial intelligence is paying off,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-launches-copilot-ai-features-as-investors-look-for-signs-artificial-intelligence-is-paying-off-093044133.html,"Microsoft (MSFT) is continuing to find ways to monetize its massive investments in artificial intelligence with an increasing array of software offerings for enterprises and consumers. The company’s latest effort is what it calls autonomous agents and comes as Wall Street prepares to scrutinize tech companies’ AI spending and growth.

During its AI Tour event in London on Monday, which included keynotes by CEO Satya Nadella and chief marketing officer of Copilot at Work Jared Spataro, Microsoft announced that the new software will be available for public preview next month.

Essentially custom-built AI apps that can handle specific tasks for enterprise workers, autonomous agents are meant to free up employees’ time to handle other projects. Microsoft pointed to companies like McKinsey & Company and the UK-based Pets at Home that have used their own agents to cut down on time-consuming work including data entry and processing client proposals.

Users can build their own autonomous agents in Copilot Studio using what Microsoft refers to as low-code or no-code instructions. Basically, you give the autonomous agent a purpose, like sorting through incoming email requests for service.

From there, you tell the agent, in natural language with no coding, what to do with the email, the kind of information it needs to pull out of the message, and what to do if any data is missing or otherwise unavailable. You can then attach different files and documents outlining how to handle customer data and then set the agent to work.

Microsoft also included the ability for workers to step in and check the agent’s work to ensure its accuracy, as well as deal with any potential hallucinations, or errors introduced by the AI itself.

Microsoft’s autonomous agents are part of a broader effort to take advantage of and get a return on its investments in AI, including its team-up with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

In its most recent quarterly report, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the company spent $19 billion on capital expenditures, including finance leases, the majority of which came from AI and cloud-related needs. In total, Microsoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures through its fiscal 2024. That’s up from $31.9 billion in 2023, and $29.2 billion in 2022.

The company says 2.1 million users currently engage with Copilot via its Microsoft business applications each month, a number the tech giant is keen on raising. The company is banking heavily on its AI-powered Copilot platform to generate revenue from businesses looking to take advantage of the software to improve overall worker efficiency.",MSFT,yes,eod,508
2024-10-21T09:30:00+00:00,Inside Microsoft's AI strategy: Compete with everybody on everything,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/inside-microsofts-ai-strategy-compete-093000944.html,"LOS ANGELES — At a Microsoft (MSFT) event here earlier this month, attendees sipped drinks and sampled hors d’oeuvres as Kendrick Lamar pulsed through the speakers. They meandered between rows of laptops, each demonstrating the latest capabilities of the company’s flagship AI product, Copilot. True to the city’s reputation, many of those present were influencers, filming their interactions with the technology for their followers.



Yet even these arbiters of digital trends seemed genuinely intrigued. The artificial intelligence updates on display marked a significant shift from Microsoft’s previous focus on business productivity, with features that appealed to a broader audience — including tech-savvy influencers.



The tech giant’s latest offerings represent a significant leap forward in personalized AI, integrating voice and vision features that promise to transform how users interact with the technology. Among the additions to Microsoft’s Copilot are a visual recognition tool, chatty conversational abilities, and a virtual news anchor.



Microsoft isn’t done with Copilot announcements, with even more updates announced at a London event Monday morning. The ambitious moves position Copilot as a direct challenger to AI products made by Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Adobe (ADBE), and even OpenAI, one of the company’s partners and the maker of ChatGPT.

By combining advanced language processing with visual and auditory capabilities, and envisioning how AI could help people throughout their day, Microsoft is aiming to become the go-to AI platform for both work and personal life.

The Copilot revamp is the first major initiative led by Mustafa Suleyman since his appointment as CEO of Microsoft AI. Suleyman, a co-founder of DeepMind and the startup Inflection AI, joined Microsoft earlier this year when the tech giant acquired Inflection.



“At Microsoft AI, we are creating an AI companion for everyone,” Suleyman wrote in a blog post.



Carolina Milanesi, the president and principal analyst at Creative Strategies, went to an accompanying Copilot launch event in New York and described it as Suleyman’s coming out party.



“It was the first time Microsoft talked about the consumer,” she said in an interview. Milanesi noted that some of the demos were running on iOS or Android devices, signaling Microsoft’s intent to reach users across all platforms.



Milanesi said it was also the first time she thought that Microsoft could appeal to the non-business side of people’s lives beyond search and gaming. The focus on the updated Copilot app, one of the primary ways to interact with the tech, is an especially important move, given how much time people spend on their phones. By launching it for iOS and Android, Microsoft has beaten both Apple and Samsung to the punch in bringing a comprehensive AI assistant to smartphones.



“Consumers are still not quite sure what the return on investment is,” Milanesi said of using phones with AI capabilities. “Having an app that delivers value to you is going to be easier to see versus when it’s embedded across the device.”



The strategy gives Microsoft a window of opportunity to establish itself in the mobile AI space before Apple rolls out its Apple Intelligence or Samsung embraces solutions like Google’s Gemini. Whether Copilot will live up to other offerings, Microsoft’s strategy is clear.



“Whatever they sell,” Milanesi said, “generative AI is part of it and will drive a differentiation in what they’re selling.”



Not long after investing a reported $13 billion in OpenAI last year, Microsoft announced AI assistants it calls Copilots, which plug into its biggest software products including Word, Excel and PowerPoint — all powered at least in part by ChatGPT. The Copilots are meant to make work easier by doing things like generating slide decks or creating notes from a Zoom meeting.

But Microsoft’s latest Copilot update reaches far beyond the workday, challenging a wide array of existing tools. Taking cues from OpenAI’s recent voice innovations in ChatGPT, Microsoft has given its AI assistant a human-like conversational ability. Users can now choose from four distinct voices and engage in natural, flowing dialogues with Copilot. The AI allows for mid-conversation interruptions and follow-up questions, mirroring the back-and-forth of chatting with a real person.



Even Microsoft’s Paint app, once the lowliest of visual editing tools, now comes with generative AI abilities that compete with Adobe’s Firefly. A feature in the app called Image Creator lets users generate images from any text description. Doodlers can sketch out a basic scene and have Paint make it more elaborate and realistic, using a creativity slider to adjust the output.



Updates to Microsoft’s Edge browser, which has Copilot built-in, can now summarize page contents in Bing searches, a shot across the bow at Google’s rocky foray into AI-infused search.



Other updates also take on Google. Copilot Daily creates audio summaries of the news that rival NotebookLM, a Google AI product that can take text and generate a podcast in minutes.



But at the heart of Copilot’s overhaul is Microsoft’s ambitious foray into visual AI: Copilot Vision. This feature gives the assistant the ability to comprehend and analyze the content of web pages in real-time, effectively allowing it to “see” alongside the user. By integrating this visual acuity with its enhanced voice capabilities, Copilot can now engage in nuanced, context-aware dialogue about on-screen content — be it text, images, or multimedia. So far, only a select number of paid subscribers have access to this service.



Even with all these announcements, Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, downgraded his rating on Microsoft stock from “Buy” to “Neutral.”



“Our perspective on Microsoft is still very positive,” Luria said in an interview. “They’re doing a lot to provide both enterprise and consumers with AI tools. Our recent downgrade is predicated more on the fact that we think that in many regards, Amazon (AMZN) and Google have caught up, and in some regards they’re even in the lead.”



Luria said that while Microsoft is ahead of the curve for many AI offerings, AI chip development, a very time-consuming process, is a key area where Microsoft lags its rivals. Google started work on its chips over a decade ago, with Amazon following a few years later.



“Microsoft was a little late to the party in realizing that they can’t just depend on Nvidia (NVDA),” Luria said, referring to the AI chipmaking behemoth. “So they’ve only had a couple of years of development into their products.”



D.A. Davidson has found that while Amazon and Google have extensively deployed their own custom chips across their data centers, Microsoft has not achieved the same level of broad deployment.



“They started their chip development later than Amazon and Google,” Luria said. “But apart from that, they’re doing what they need to do.”



Microsoft rode the wave of AI enthusiasm in 2023, with its stock surging almost 57% last year. But 2024 has proven to be a more challenging landscape for the tech giant. Microsoft stock has risen about 12% so far this year, trailing most of its peers and even the broader S&P 500 index.

While Microsoft has not yet disclosed specific revenue figures for generative AI products such as Copilot, the company has provided some insight into AI’s impact on its business. During its last quarterly earnings call in July, Microsoft said its cloud service saw 29% year-over-year revenue growth, with 8 percentage points of that growth attributable to AI services.



If it becomes a seamless part of people’s lives, Microsoft’s Copilot could unlock new revenue streams and solidify the company’s position in both consumer and enterprise markets. The challenge lies in creating AI tools that are not just innovative, but indispensable to users’ daily lives and work processes.



“Our task is to ensure AI always enriches people’s lives and strengthens our bonds with others, while supporting our uniqueness and endlessly complex humanity,” Suleyman wrote. “This is a new era of technology that doesn’t just ‘solve problems,’ it’s there to support you, teach you and help you.”

This week, Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) both announced nuclear power agreements following a deal by Microsoft (MSFT) in September to purchase nuclear energy from Constellation Energy (CEG).

While the artificial intelligence boom has boosted revenues for major tech companies, the massive demand for energy is hindering sustainability efforts. Earlier this year, both Google and Microsoft said neither company is on track to meet its climate targets.

Demand for data centers will continue to rise as big tech sets its ambitions on more powerful AI models. Despite the environmental toll, experts say data and other AI infrastructure will be the winners of AI’s next phase.

One query on OpenAI’s ChatGPT needs almost 10 times as much electricity as a Google search on average, according to a Goldman Sachs (GS) study.

But the startup’s founder, Sam Altman, is one of many tech leaders who are interested in tapping into alternative energy sources and novel storage schemes to mitigate AI’s energy problem.

Here are three energy-focused startups Altman has invested in.

Altman was a lead investor in Oklo’s seed round in January 2015, but has since exited the deal, according to PitchBook.

The nuclear power company, which has three project sites, says it’s “developing next-generation fission powerhouses to produce abundant, affordable, clean energy at a global scale.” Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse can produce 15 megawatts of electrical power (MWe), which the company says can scale up to 50 MWe and operate for ten years or longer before needing to be refueled.

Oklo has seen its shares climb over 200% in the past month.

Altman was a lead investor in Helion Energy’s Series E Round in November 2021, which raised $500 million, according to PitchBook. The OpenAI leader invested $375 million into the company, which is focused on fusion energy.

Helion claims to be the first private fusion company to have the technology that can reach the high temperature needed to produce fusion energy. Fusion could supply data centers with energy, Scott Krisiloff, Helion’s chief business officer, told Business Insider.

Last May, Microsoft agreed to buy 50 megawatts of electricity from Helion by 2028. That amount of electricity is enough to power 40,000 homes.

In January 2023, Altman said he’s “just super excited about what’s going to happen” with Helion, according to TechCrunch.

Altman was a lead investor in Exowatt’s seed round in April, which raised $20 million, according to PitchBook.

The startup develops modules that store energy as heat and produce electricity for AI data centers. Exowatt’s shipping container-sized modules are fitted with solar lenses that turn the sun’s energy into heat, which can warm up cheap material, and can be stored for up to 24 hours. The modules then produce electricity by passing the stored heat through an engine.

“You don’t have to go back to fossil fuels to solve the data-center energy problem…That’s counterproductive,” Hannan Parvizian, chief executive of Exowatt, told the Wall Street Journal.

2024-10-21T00:00:00+00:00,Is Microsoft Going to $505? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/21/is-microsoft-going-to-505-1-wall-street-analyst-th/,"KeyBanc just raised its price target on Microsoft.

Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) was an earlier winner in artificial intelligence (AI) thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. But lately, investors have been moving away from the enterprise software giant, enticed by Apple's new Apple Intelligence AI platform, and Nvidia's Blackwell platform.

Microsoft has lost its title of the world's most valuable company to Apple and recently fell behind Nvidia for the second-most valuable company in the world. The stock is now down 10% from its peak in July, and it's missed out on the latest rally in tech stocks as the Nasdaq Composite is back near all-time highs.

However, one analyst sees upside potential in Microsoft.

In a note on Friday morning, KeyCorp hiked its price target on Microsoft from $490 to $505 and maintained an overweight rating on the stock. The research firm said a recent survey showed a rebound in the company's performance and IT budgets heading into next year. KeyBanc found that IT budgets were now expected to grow 4.4% in 2025, compared with an earlier forecast of 3.2%.

That finding certainly looks like a positive for Microsoft as corporate IT spending is a primary determinant of its growth. KeyBanc's new price target implies a 21% upside in the stock.

Microsoft remains the dominant enterprise software company, but there are valid questions facing the stock, including its valuation at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35 and its ability to justify its investments in AI, as the company faces some skepticism on that front.

Additionally, The New York Times just reported that its partnership with OpenAI is facing some tensions as Microsoft wants a payoff from its investment in OpenAI and is interested in investing in other AI start-ups.

We should learn more when the tech giant reports earnings later this month. While its Azure cloud infrastructure business has been a bright spot, the company may need more than that for the stock to get back to its winning ways.",MSFT,yes,eod,407
2024-10-21T00:00:00+00:00,Better AI Stock: Microsoft vs. Lumen Technologies,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/21/better-ai-stock-microsoft-vs-lumen-technologies/,"Which of these AI-oriented tech stocks is a better buy today?

In the past, Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) and Lumen (LUMN 2.55%), the telecom company formerly known as CenturyLink, weren't often mentioned in the same breath. Microsoft was a rapidly growing tech giant with plenty of irons in the fire across the cloud, mobile, AI, and gaming markets. But Lumen was a struggling telecom company which had doubled down on the dying business wireline market instead of building higher-growth wireless networks.

By this June, Lumen's stock had dipped below $1. That was more than 95% below its all-time high from 2014. But in July, Lumen drove away the bears by securing a new networking and fiber deal with Microsoft's Azure, the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform. The market's enthusiasm for that deal propelled Lumen's stock back to $6.

So in an odd twist, investors who bought Lumen's stock when it slumped to $1 actually outperformed Microsoft's investors over the past four months. But can Lumen keep generating bigger gains than Microsoft for the foreseeable future?

Lumen's revenue has declined for five consecutive years. It's also been unprofitable over the past two years, and it suspended its dividend in 2022. That meltdown was mainly caused by the decline of its wireline business, which offset the stronger growth of its fiber business and its ancillary sales of cloud, security, and collaboration services.

However, Lumen's focus on business wireline connections actually made it an ideal partner for Microsoft, which needed to rapidly expand its data center infrastructure to support its growing ecosystem of cloud, mobile, and AI applications. Therefore, those growth engines within Microsoft could generate strong long-term tailwinds for Lumen's wireline business.

Before Microsoft swooped in, Lumen was in serious trouble. It ended 2023 with a negative free cash flow (FCF) of $878 million, and it was still shouldering $18.4 billion in long-term debt in its latest quarter with a whopping debt-to-equity ratio of 70. For 2024, analysts expect its revenue to decline 11% to $13 billion with a net loss of $252 million.

But in early August, Lumen said it had secured $5 billion in new business (including Microsoft's Azure deal) related to the AI connectivity market. It also said it was in ""active discussions"" to ""secure another $7 billion in sales opportunities"" and would aim to ""more than double its intercity network miles over the next five years."" It expects the initial payments from those contracts to boost its annual FCF to positive $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2024.

Lumen's statement suggests it could potentially generate $5 billion to $12 billion in revenues over the next five years ($1 billion to $2.4 billion annually) from its new AI-related contracts. That would equal about 7% to 16% of its estimated revenue in 2023, but we don't know if those tailwinds can offset the ongoing decline of its non-AI business wireline division.

Analysts still expect Lumen's revenue to decline in 2025 and 2026 -- so they don't seem convinced its new AI contracts will fix its business. But with an enterprise value of $23 billion, Lumen's stock looks cheap at less than 2 times this year's sales.

But it probably won't stay ahead of Microsoft over the long term

Lumen outperformed Microsoft in recent months, but that was mainly because the Azure deal brought its stock back from the brink of a delisting. It could be tough for Lumen to maintain that momentum if its new AI deals don't move the needle.

As for Microsoft, the tech giant is still firing on all cylinders as it prioritizes the expansion of its cloud, mobile, and AI ecosystems. Under Satya Nadella, who took the helm as its CEO in 2014, Microsoft transformed its productivity software into sticky cloud-based services, expanded Azure's cloud infrastructure platform, invested in ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, and shrewdly integrated the start-up's generative AI tools into its own applications. It also launched new hardware devices and expanded Xbox's gaming business with more acquisitions and cloud-based services.

That's why Microsoft's annual revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2024 (which ended last June) as its EPS grew at a CAGR of 16%. Analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow 14% and 11%, respectively, in fiscal 2025.

Those double-digit growth rates indicate Microsoft still has room to run. But it also has a market cap of $3.1 trillion, making it the world's third-most valuable company, and its stock isn't cheap at 32 times forward earnings. In other words, a lot of growth has already been baked into Microsoft's stock price -- and it might stay in its holding pattern until its profits catch up to its valuations again. Any near-term issues with Azure, its main growth engine, could also limit its upside potential.

That said, I believe it's still smarter to buy Microsoft as a long-term AI play than Lumen. It's bigger, growing faster, more broadly diversified, and has a much wider moat. Lumen might generate bigger near-term gains than Microsoft, but it could quickly fizzle out if the high costs of its big AI connectivity deals crush its long-term margins.",MSFT,yes,eod,1150

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024.

The tech sector has been showing positive performance amid market concerns, driven by improved earnings estimates and substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Approximately 40% of operating cash flow is currently allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will begin to yield returns. The strong profit margins of mega-cap stocks, averaging over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors, suggest continued capital inflows into tech companies demonstrating earnings strength. While some consolidation and growth slowdown may occur, there is confidence that investor sentiment will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.

As sentiments shift regarding major tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining positive momentum in the market. There was a conversation regarding this, covered a few days back in our article about the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In, where Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, discussed the tech sector’s mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Here’s an excerpt from his sentiment:

Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on October 17 and highlighted that there’s a likelihood that the markets could move into choppier territory. Katie Stockton characterized her stance as neutral regarding the indices despite the strength of the trend and the participation of most stocks on the upside. She noted that while short-term momentum is currently positive, particularly behind major indices, there are concerns about potential problems if key players like NVIDIA falter. She highlighted that sentiment appears overly bullish or greedy, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index reaching an extreme level of 5%. This situation makes it challenging for the market to sustain overbought conditions, which are prevalent across various timeframes.

Stockton anticipates a pullback or possibly a more significant corrective phase in the fourth quarter for the S&P 500, suggesting that this could mark the beginning of a range-bound environment. She pointed to indicators such as the VIX, which has entered a new higher volatility cycle, and mentioned signs of long-term exhaustion indicated by the DeMark indicators, levels not seen collectively since late 2021. While this does not necessarily signal an impending bear market, it does enhance the likelihood of experiencing a choppier trading environment. When asked about the recent performance of banks and cyclical stocks compared to defensive stocks, Stockton acknowledged that while there has been a positive move from the financial sector contributing to the S&P 500’s recent gains, it is too early to conclude that this represents a breakout in relative strength for financials. She indicated that most metrics suggest financials will likely perform in line with broader market trends rather than leading them. Furthermore, she expressed concern that mega-cap sectors are poised to lose their leadership position, which could pose challenges to overall market performance. Regarding small-cap stocks, Stockton noted that while the Russell 2000 index made another attempt at an upside move, closing close to 2,300 with a 1.6% increase, long-term trends still indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500. She pointed out that there has not been a breakout in the Russell 2000, which remains stalled below resistance levels established during summer highs. Consequently, she does not see actionable opportunities in small caps at this time and anticipates neutral trading conditions for this segment. On the topic of bonds, Stockton mentioned that Treasury yields have shown some upside momentum but backed off recently. She sees potential entry points in Treasury bond proxies like TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), suggesting signs of short-term downside exhaustion within a broader long-term uptrend for fixed income. She believes there is an opportunity for investors to enter Treasury bond proxies now, while also expecting yields to stall without significant long-term declines. Her insights highlight her focus on maintaining balance amid prevailing uncertainties in both equity and bond markets.

2024-10-20T18:42:25+00:00,Microsoft Corp. (MSFT): Among the Best US Stocks for Foreign Investors Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corp-msft-among-best-184225630.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other US stocks.

Despite previous recession predictions, the market has shown resilience and continued to rise, largely due to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. Current market valuations are trading at approximately 22 times earnings during an easing cycle, raising questions about future earnings growth. There seems to be a disconnect between expectations for significant easing and projected strong earnings growth.

Investors are encouraged to remain vigilant and consider the evolving economic landscape as they navigate potential market shifts. Earlier in October, Jason Trennert, Strategas Research Partners chairman and CEO, joined CNBC to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy, highlighting that the bar is high to get bearish now. We covered his opinion in our article about the 8 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Invest In Now in much more detail. Here's an excerpt from that discussion:

On October 16, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to discuss the latest market trends, highlighting that he has never seen investors this afraid of a market that's doing so well. J.J. Kinahan noted that the upcoming weeks would be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and the impending election, alongside uncertainty surrounding the Fed's next moves. He remarked on the market's resilience, highlighting that there have been 46 new highs for the S&P 500 this year, despite a general sentiment of skepticism among investors. He expressed that it is unusual for a market to perform so well while simultaneously being viewed with caution and fear.

Kinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents' experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. He also speculated that part of the reason for the market's strong performance might be attributed to older investors who have been burned in previous downturns and are now waiting for a pullback that has yet to materialize. Kinahan suggested that as these investors gradually capitulate, they may start to invest more actively in the market. Discussing interest rates, Kinahan acknowledged that while the Fed is in a massive easing cycle, there seems to be a disconnect with the bond market recently. He mentioned a study indicating that volatility during election years is not significantly greater than in non-election years. Currently, volatility is relatively low, hovering around a historical average of 20, and only recently rising to this level. He explained that typically, volatility tends to increase after elections, when political changes begin to take effect and policies, are implemented. He anticipated that January would bring more clarity regarding how these changes might impact the markets. Kinahan's insights reflect a complex interplay between investor sentiment, market performance, and external economic factors as they navigate through earnings season and an election year. His perspective underscores a cautious optimism about the market's ability to maintain its upward trajectory despite prevailing uncertainties. To find the best US stocks for foreign investors, we used Insider Monkey's proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite and that analysts were bullish on. We then selected the top 8 stocks with the highest average analysts' upside potential. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their average analysts' upside potential, as of October 16. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational technology company that develops, licenses, and supports computer software, consumer electronics, and personal computers. Founded in 1975, it became the world's largest software maker by revenue in the mid-1990s through the success of its Windows operating system. Today, it offers a range of products and services, including the Windows operating system, Office productivity suite, Azure cloud computing platform, Xbox gaming consoles, and Surface devices. The company's FQ4 2024 was a success, with revenue reaching $64.73 billion, up 15.20% year-over-year, earning $2.95 per share. Microsoft Cloud led the way, generating $36.8 billion, up 21%, with record bookings. Office commercial sales hit $48 billion, while individual Office sales reached $6.2 billion, up 4%. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales grew 19% to $6.3 billion. Bing also saw a 3% increase as more users switched from Google Search. Its Azure OpenAI service has seen a 60% surge in customers, reaching 60,000 in the past quarter. Azure revenue surged by 30%. Partnerships with Lumen Technologies and Palantir strengthen its AI leadership and cloud capabilities. These strategic moves make Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) a promising investment for investors seeking growth and returns. The company's growth extends beyond cloud services. Its Copilot software, an AI-powered productivity assistant, is gaining traction. Microsoft 365 Copilot customer numbers grew over 60% sequentially in FQ4. With an Office 365 user base exceeding 400 million, its future of productivity tools looks promising. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years. Overall MSFT ranks 7th on our list of the best US stocks for foreign investors right now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-10-20T16:21:46+00:00,3 Must-Watch Tech Earnings Reports Coming Up,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-must-watch-tech-earnings-162146744.html,"Three major players—Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon—are set to release their quarterly earnings reports, and all eyes will be on these updates to assess their growth, resilience, and ability to drive future trends.

These earnings reports are particularly important as they will reveal how these tech leaders are leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, expanding cloud computing services, and navigating macroeconomic challenges such as changing consumer habits, monetary policy, and geopolitical uncertainties.

Investors will also be watching closely to see whether these companies can help sustain the rally in the U.S. stock market. Last week, the S&P 500 reached a new all-time high, marking a 23% year-to-date gain, while the Dow Jones closed above the 43,000 mark for the first time, signaling continued optimism about market growth.

According to Bank of America, as earnings season kicked off, 30 companies in the S&P 500 surpassed earnings expectations by an average of 5%, up from 3% at the start of the last quarter. An additional 41 S&P 500 companies reported results last week. However, with the S&P 500 currently trading at around 21.8 times forward earnings—well above its long-term average of 15.7—some analysts caution that stock valuations may be stretched. Any disappointment in these reports could trigger a market correction as investors reassess valuations.

As we look ahead to big tech’s upcoming releases, here’s what to watch for:

Microsoft delivered stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter, with total revenue rising 15% year-over-year. Net income climbed to $22.04 billion, up from $20.08 billion in the same quarter last year, translating to $2.69 per share.

While these results were solid, investor attention was focused on Azure’s performance, which fell below expectations for the first time since 2022. Azure and other cloud services posted 29% revenue growth, but this missed consensus estimates, sparking concerns about whether Microsoft’s cloud unit is losing momentum in an increasingly competitive market.

Despite the Azure miss, Microsoft’s management remains optimistic about future growth, suggesting potential acceleration in the coming quarters. However, investors remain cautious, as Azure’s performance is now a critical driver of Microsoft’s overall growth, especially as cloud computing continues to gain importance across industries.

As Microsoft prepares to release its fiscal Q1 2025 earnings on Tuesday, Oct. 22, after market close, all eyes will be on Azure once again. Analysts are forecasting a profit of $3.10 per share, with total revenue expected to dip slightly from $64.73 billion to $64.54 billion.

So far this year, Microsoft shares are up 12.75%, hovering around $418. 2# Can IBM’s Share Price Hit New Highs with a Strong Earnings Surprise? IBM has made notable progress in its business, particularly with its focus on generative artificial intelligence, which played a key role in its strong performance last quarter. In its second-quarter earnings report from July, IBM exceeded analysts’ expectations, reporting a 1.9% revenue increase to $15.48 billion compared to the previous year. Net income also rose significantly to $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, up from $1.58 billion, or $1.72 per share, a year earlier. Despite these gains, IBM faces several macroeconomic challenges, including higher interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical uncertainties, which may impact its growth. Still, the company remains confident in its tech-driven approach, particularly in AI and cloud computing, which it believes will fuel future success. As IBM prepares to release its Q3 2024 earnings on Wednesday, Oct. 23, investors are eager to see if the company can once again exceed expectations. Analysts forecast a slower profit of $2.22 per share, down from $2.43 in the previous quarter, and a slight revenue dip from $15.77 billion to $15.06 billion. If IBM delivers a strong performance—boosted by AI adoption or robust hybrid cloud growth—it could reignite investor confidence and push the share price to new highs. So far this year, IBM shares are up 43.78%, hovering around $232. 3# Is Amazon Still Losing Ground to Its Peers? Amazon reported softer-than-expected revenue for the second quarter, alongside a disappointing forecast for the third quarter. Net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $148.0 billion, up from $134.4 billion in the same period last year, but fell short of the $148.56 billion projected by analysts at LSEG. Despite the revenue miss, Amazon saw a significant boost in profitability, with net income climbing to $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to $6.7 billion, or $0.65 per diluted share, a year ago. The underwhelming revenue performance is largely attributed to sluggish growth in Amazon’s core retail business, where competition from discount platforms like Temu and Shein has intensified. These rivals, which allow Chinese merchants to sell low-cost products to U.S. consumers, are eating into Amazon’s market share. Sales in Amazon’s online stores segment grew just 5% year-over-year, reflecting consumers opting for cheaper products and leading to a decline in the company’s average selling price (ASP). On the cloud front, Amazon Web Services (AWS) performed well, growing 19% year-over-year and generating $26.3 billion in revenue, surpassing estimates of $26 billion. However, AWS is expanding at a slower pace compared to its major competitors, Microsoft and Google, whose cloud divisions are growing more rapidly. As Amazon looks ahead, the company faces the challenge of balancing slow retail growth with rising competition in both e-commerce and cloud computing, adding pressure to innovate and find new growth opportunities in the next quarter. So far this year, Amazon shares are up 26.05%, hovering around $188. CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. Between 66% and 83% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.

2024-10-20T15:00:19+00:00,Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best IoT Stock To Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-best-iot-150019461.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other IoT stocks.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network connecting physical objects to the internet. Industries are embracing IoT technologies for applications like smart manufacturing and supply chain management. Enterprise IoT spending is expected to slow down in the second half of this year due to economic concerns which will affect corporate spending in general. However, corporate spending on IoT will rebound in 2025. The global market for IoT is expected to grow at a rate of 24.3% annually between 2024 and 2032. In 2032, it is expected to reach a value of $4,062.34 billion.

The rise of smart homes, buildings, and manufacturing, along with advancements in smart infrastructure, is driving significant growth in the IoT market. Moreover, smart city initiatives are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing population and expansion of cities. Consumers are adopting smart city solutions, including smart utility meters, transportation, waste management, grids, and air quality controllers.

IoT adoption is also growing rapidly in other sectors, particularly healthcare. The global IoT in healthcare market is projected to expand significantly and reach $952.3 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%. IoT is a major force behind healthcare's digital transformation, revolutionizing the way medical data is collected, analyzed, and used. This is leading to better patient care, greater operational efficiencies, and innovative treatments.

IoT is also seeing increased adoption in warehouse management. The global IoT warehouse management market is projected to grow from $14.8 billion in 2023 to $57.2 billion by 2033, reflecting a CAGR of 14.5% over the next decade. This growth is driven by the need for better inventory management, increased automation, and improved operational efficiency in logistics and supply chain operations.

By allowing IoT devices to process and store data locally, edge AI reduces lag and allows real-time responses. Incorporating AI into IoT devices within industries offers numerous benefits, including improved operational efficiency, safety, and decision-making. It plays an important role in predictive maintenance and supply chain management.

The future of IoT looks promising. Businesses and investors can expect significant returns as the technology continues to evolve. Keeping this context in mind, let’s take a look at the best IoT stocks to buy now. To create our list of the 10 best IoT stocks to buy, we focused on companies that offer IoT solutions or products, including firms involved in manufacturing IoT devices and hardware. The companies have been shortlisted based on hedge fund sentiment, sourced from our database of over 900 hedge funds. The best IoT stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported strong Q4 2024 results. Revenue increased 16% to $245.1 billion, driven by growth in all segments, particularly Azure and other cloud services. Net income rose 22% to $88.1 billion. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud revenue reached $36.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year. With the company’s strong financial performance, analysts are optimistic about its future. The stock has received an average “Moderate Buy” rating with a price target of $494.72.

The company’s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all scales. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of innovative, AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs.

2024-10-20T09:51:00+00:00,3 Stocks That Could Be Big Winners if Kamala Harris Wins but the GOP Controls Congress,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-could-big-winners-095100059.html,"Americans could be looking at a couple more years of a divided government. Vice President Kamala Harris has an average 2.8% lead over former President Donald Trump across 256 polls of the presidential race. Decision Desk HQ's models show a 72% chance of Republicans regaining a majority in the Senate and a 53% chance of holding onto a majority in the House of Representatives.

Of course, polls don't decide elections; voters do. It's not too soon for investors to evaluate what they might do based on the November results, though. What if the polls turn out to be right? Here are three stocks that could be big winners if Harris wins but the GOP controls Congress.

Democrats and Republicans don't agree with each other on many topics. However, the need for the U.S. to be the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) is one area where they're on the same page. Members of both major political parties are working together on the House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence to ""explore how Congress can ensure America continues to lead the world in AI innovation while considering guardrails that may be appropriate to safeguard the nation against current and emerging threats.""

Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) could benefit from bipartisan support of U.S. AI leadership. The California-based company is a top provider of semiconductors and networking infrastructure used in AI data centers. Seven of the eight-biggest AI clusters in the world rely on Broadcom's Ethernet networking technology.

With Harris as president, Broadcom won't be negatively impacted by the steep tariffs that Trump has proposed. On the other hand, with the GOP controlling Congress, Harris probably couldn't get her proposed corporate tax increases passed. It's a win-win proposition for Broadcom.

Regardless of who the next president is or which party has a majority in Congress, though, Broadcom's long-term prospects look strong. As AI becomes more powerful, organizations will need to upgrade their servers, networks, and data-storage devices. This should drive demand for Broadcom's products for years to come.

Many Democrats and Republicans believe in improving the nation's infrastructure as well as agreeing on the importance of U.S. dominance in AI. Politicians of all stripes want the economy to be strong. History shows that the U.S. economy has performed better under Democratic presidents than Republican presidents since World War II. But the stock market has performed best when those Democratic presidents had at least one house of Congress controlled by the GOP.

A divided government with Harris as president could be an ideal scenario for Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIP) (NYSE: BIPC). The company operates pipelines, terminals, rail, and other infrastructure assets that benefit from a booming economy. It also owns data centers and semiconductor-manufacturing foundries, both of which are growth markets partly due to the AI tailwind. Income investors will especially like Brookfield Infrastructure's distributions. Its limited partnership units trading under the BIP ticker offer a forward-distribution yield of 4.5%. Its corporate shares trading under the BIPC ticker offer a forward-distribution yield of 3.8%. These distributions have increased by a compound annual growth rate of 9% since 2009. What if the economy doesn't fare well with Harris in the White House and Republicans controlling the House and/or Senate? Brookfield Infrastructure's business is remarkably resilient with 90% of its funds from operations (FFO) contracted or regulated. Harris and Republicans could also find common ground on cybersecurity. The vice president has been an advocate for protecting IT infrastructure against threats in the past. The GOP's 2024 platform included language about cybersecurity. The views of both parties tie in with their AI priorities. Few companies stand at the forefront of both AI and cybersecurity as much as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The company is the second-largest cloud-service provider and offers extensive AI capabilities. It has integrated AI throughout its productivity-software applications. Microsoft also markets cybersecurity products and services. I think Microsoft would keep up its winning ways with Democrats or Republicans in power. The opportunities with AI are so big that the company can be successful even if legislators put a few roadblocks in its path. Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this. On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:
• Amazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,285!*
• Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $44,456!*
• Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $411,959!* Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

2024-10-20T05:03:24+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Among the Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-among-most-050324682.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks owned by hedge funds.

Wall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a ‘substantial majority’ of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead.

The broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank’s next meeting in November.

However, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth.

She noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas.

Fundstrat Global Advisors’ co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month:

Earlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to ‘buy the dip’, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value.

Adam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast. With that said, let’s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American technology company, best known for its operating systems and software products. It is the second most valuable company in the world after having tripled its valuation over the last three years to reach the $3 trillion mark. The company continues to garner investors’ confidence through increased spending on artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure. Microsoft spent $19 billion on capital expenditure during its fourth quarter of FY 2024, which ended in June. This was a 35% increase in spending from the March quarter. Here is what Mar Vista Focus stated regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses, both large and small, navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions.

The company also reported robust financial results during Q4 2024, with quarterly revenue recorded at $64.7 billion. This took the total annual revenue figure to $245 billion, representing a 15% increase from 2023. EPS for the quarter surged 10% year-over-year to reach $2.95 per share, beating analysts’ expectations of $2.94. The strong performance was largely attributed to Microsoft Cloud, which generated $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, and a 17% increase in commercial bookings, driven by millions of dollars of contracts for both Microsoft 365 and Azure. Heading into FY 2025, the company expects current encouraging trends to continue and has forecasted double-digit growth for both revenue and operating income for the year. There were some segments where numbers declined for Microsoft during the quarter, such as Xbox hardware sales experiencing a 42% dip and devices revenue decreasing 11%. Despite that, the overall outlook for the company looks promising. Street analysts have consensus on the stock’s Strong Buy rating and anticipate a share price upside of 18% in the coming months. Moreover, according to Insider Monkey’s database for Q2, 279 hedge funds had investments in the company, making it one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-10-20T01:33:57+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Promising Tech Stock Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-hedge-funds-013357575.html,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other promising tech stocks.

Big tech is expected to outperform in the coming months. On October 2, Ari Wald, Oppenheimer's Head of Technical Analysis, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis and explain why investors must consider high-growth companies.

Wald highlights that market breadth is expected to remain high supporting extended highs throughout the end of 2024. In addition to that, he expects the bull cycle to remain intact and believes the trend will continue in 2025. During the late summer, the market saw a change in the high beta versus low volatility ratio stocks. It was seen that high-beta stocks could not keep up with high dividend-paying and lower-volatility names.

Given the rotational nature of the market, Wald expects higher beta names to make a strong comeback and reclaim their leadership position. Wald suggests that investors should consider investing in higher growth companies, as the Nasdaq and Russel 100 are expected to lead again. Trends show that the mag seven is growing and climbing, as the market conditions continue to settle.

Viewing Tech Stocks on Valuations Alone is Wrong, Strategist Says

Technology stocks have more room to run. On October 14, Malcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the technology market outlook and revealed his favorite picks.

Ethridge suggests that judging stocks based on their valuations alone is a big mistake, especially in the current market cycle which is heavily influenced by the AI boom. Looking at the broader perspective, he believes there are a lot of positive opportunities among the magnificent seven and outside of it.

He adds that companies among the mega tech have been pouring billions into generating large language models and the likes of it. He also suggests that most of this technology is yet to be understood and therefore the true value we can derive from these technologies is yet to come. These companies also have a lot of intrinsic value and there is more to be realized soon.

Now that we have studied the technology market outlook, let's take a look at the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. You can also read our piece on the most promising AI stocks according to analysts.

To come up with the most promising technology stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising tech stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment as of Q2 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a well-known technology company behind the commonly used Microsoft Suite. The company also develops cloud products and personal computing products. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is pouring capital into artificial intelligence. Over the past few months, the company has closed deals with startups and technology companies to run their workloads on Microsoft Azure, its cloud platform. A few days ago, the company made an addition to its list of partnerships by signing an agreement with Rezolve AI, a startup revolutionizing the online retail landscape. In addition to that, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with other crucial stakeholders made a $100 billion deal to improve the functioning of data centers and artificial intelligence. The company has also been making strategic investments in AI and data in other countries. Chad Morganlander, Washington Crossing Advisors' Senior Portfolio Manager and Co-Founder, appeared on Yahoo Finance on April 27, emphasizing the importance of MSFT. He shares that MSFT is one of the highest-quality stocks an investor can own. He adds that with its dividend-paying history and investments in AI, the company is likely to experience lower earnings volatility. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a long-standing company with immensely strong fundamentals. This coupled with its investments in AI and data make it one of the most promising stocks according to hedge funds. Fred Alger Management’s Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: ""Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity."" Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

2024-10-19T18:11:20+00:00,Analysts Say Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) Among Top Beneficiaries of AI Data Center Spend,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-181120716.html,"We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. Since Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Wall Street continues to gain momentum amid the latest earnings season and analysts are wondering whether we are still up for soft landing. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said:

“I think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.”

The analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however.

“My probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it’s not dominant. Why isn’t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan—at the end of July, the Fed didn’t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it’s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.”

For this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Citi Research predicts that capital expenditures for data centers among the leading four cloud companies will surge by 40% year over year, offering a boost to data center interconnect (DCI) providers. The major players in this segment include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Citi anticipates that these firms will ramp up their data center investments by 40% to 50% in 2025.

Citi analysts, led by Atif Malik, noted in an investor report that “we estimate that the AI networking opportunity is expanding beyond the server connection within a data center to AI platforms connecting multiple data centers through DCI.” Citi named Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) as one of the beneficiaries of this spending. Malik emphasized the challenges of containing AI model clusters within a single data center as their size approaches 300,000 GPUs by 2025, stating that “containing models in one data center unit will not be sustainable in the long term amid constraints related to power, regulations, among others.” Consequently, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting and planning to expand the use of a multi-data center training approach. Citi highlighted that Google has utilized this multi-data center strategy for training its Gemini 1 Ultra, and that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic are also embracing this model. As a result of increased DCI spending, Citi projects that Arista’s revenue could grow by up to 25% year over year in 2025, primarily driven by Ethernet switching in AI networks. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) earlier this year announced a major restructuring plan that includes a 7% reduction in workforce and an estimated $1 billion in pre-tax cost savings. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)’s legacy hardware businesses have been stagnating, with average revenue growth lingering at just 1.6%. Job cuts and cost savings will allow Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) to allocate capital to high-growth areas like AI and Cloud networking. The expected cost savings, which will cut about 2.4% of total operating expenses, could boost Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) operating margins by more than 220 basis points in FY25. Although the company is ramping up its AI efforts, it only expects AI to bring in around $1 billion in revenue next year, less than 2% of the total. So, while AI isn’t likely to be a game-changer for Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) just yet, the focus on growth markets might accelerate overall revenue in the future. Parnassus Value Equity Fund stated the following regarding Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “During the second quarter, the Fund’s overweight position in the Information Technology sector decreased slightly as we sold our position in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and used most of the proceeds to buy Broadcom, a leading semiconductor company and provider of custom silicon products. Both stocks provide similar exposure to networking technology, but we believe Broadcom offers more upside from AI infrastructure spend and defensiveness due to its software assets.” Overall, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-10-19T13:15:12+00:00,"Nvidia to win the race to $4 trillion market cap, experts say",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-win-the-race-to-4-trillion-market-cap-experts-say-131512935.html,"That was the mindset around chip stocks last week as investors scooped up beaten-down shares, sending Nvidia (NVDA) to a record high. A strong outlook for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was enough to revive Wall Street’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence as growing confidence in the AI boom overshadowed chip supplier ASML’s sluggish forecast and reports of export caps of advanced AI chips to some Middle Eastern countries.

Nvidia closed the week above $138 per share, bringing its market value to $3.39 trillion. The stock was trading a touch higher, up 0.2%, in Monday's premarket trading.

It’s now the world's second-largest company behind Apple (AAPL). But that might not be for long. Experts I spoke with this past week say there’s growing confidence the chip giant will be the first Big Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation.

“There's no question about it,” Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts (video above). “The demand for GPU chips is strong, and you're seeing early adopters starting to get some ROI.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang fueled the stock’s rally earlier this month after describing demand for the new Blackwell chips as “insane.”

Even amid the stock’s dramatic outperformance, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Tony Wang told me investors still “continuously underestimate” Nvidia’s growth potential. He sees “exceptional” demand for AI making it “definitely possible” that the chip giant crosses that $4 trillion threshold first.

In the coming weeks, earnings from fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" companies will give investors better insight into Nvidia’s market dominance. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), which account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue, have all pledged to continue investing in AI.

Last quarter, spending by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft totaled more than $40 billion, while Amazon said spending in the second half of the year will likely surpass the $30 billion spent during the first half.

BofA analyst Vivek Arya, who views Nvidia as a “generational opportunity,” cites capital expenditure commentary from top hyperscalers among the reasons that he sees Nvidia ""strengthening its position.""

Arya lifted his price target on the chipmaker to $190 last week, implying a rally of nearly 40% from Friday’s closing price.

Arya and his team also cited Taiwan Semiconductor’s robust demand outlook as a positive. TSMC — a top supplier for Nvidia and other giants, including Apple — triggered a sector-wide rally after posting a more than 50% jump in net income for the third quarter and forecasting full-year revenue growth of nearly 30%.

Safe to say, Big Tech's third quarter numbers will be a crucial test for Nvidia and key to the stock's momentum in the short term. Any disappointment in AI spending plans could lead to volatility for Nvidia and the broader chips market. But if that happens, the sell-off may not last long. Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles recently told me on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast he remains bullish on Nvidia’s long-term prospects. “You've got several more years of AI investment before you hit saturation or a more maturing AI landscape,” Niles said. “You'll see Nvidia's revenues double over the next several years, and I think you'll see the stock double over the next several years.” Nvidia shares have rallied 21% so far this month, bringing its gains to 179% year to date.

2024-10-19T11:15:00+00:00,"The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stocks-invest-50-000-111500070.html,"For most people, $50,000 is a nice sum of money. In fact, you can buy a pretty nice car with that amount. However, instead of spending it, the best move over the long term would be to invest.

And when it comes to investing, technology stocks are one of the first places long-term investors should look. As technology, like artificial intelligence (AI), continues to transform the world we live in, technology companies have become the biggest stock market winners.

Let's look at two top tech stocks investors can buy today that are riding the AI wave. One is the leader on the hardware side, while the other is the leader on the software side. While investing $50,000 in these names would be nice, you can, of course, start with any amount.

No company has been a bigger winner from AI than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and there doesn't appear to be anything on the horizon that will stop its momentum. The company's graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of the AI infrastructure buildout, and the company recently called demand for its newest Blackwell chips ""insane.""

Nvidia has been able to take a more than 80% market share in the GPU space through its chips' strong performance, but more importantly through its CUDA software platform. Long before AI was the next big thing, CUDA became the standard platform on which developers learned to program GPUs. This created a wide moat around its booming GPU business.

Meanwhile, AI infrastructure is currently seeing no letup in demand, as major tech companies pile money into the space to develop more sophisticated AI models. As AI models advance, they need more computing power for training, and that power comes from Nvidia's GPUs. For example, Alphabet has said its new Llama 4 large language model (LLM) would need 10 times the compute power of its predecessor, while xAI's Grok 3 LLM used 5 times the number of GPUs as Grok 2. The large tech companies investing in AI infrastructure have all indicated that their spending will continue to ramp up, with Oracle saying it sees no end to AI infrastructure spending over the next five to 10 years. This all benefits Nvidia.

Despite the stock's strong performance, it is still attractively priced, trading a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of under 35 based on next year's analyst estimate and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of about 0.9. A PEG under 1 is generally viewed as undervalued, and growth stocks often carry PEGs well above 1.

Another company riding the AI wave is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which was one of the first large tech companies to go all-in on the technology when it made a large investment in and formed a partnership with OpenAI.

Thus far, its Azure cloud computing unit has been the company's biggest AI beneficiary, as organizations turn to its platform to create their own AI solutions. This is a consumption-based business where users are only charged for the resources they use, and so far, usage has been very strong. This can been seen in the company's results, with Azure growing revenue around 29% to 30% the past few quarters. Cloud computing isn't the only area the company is looking at AI to help power growth. Its GitHub Developer platform as been another big AI winner, as customers turned to its AI assistant, Copilot, which can make suggestions as developers type and even complete coding tasks. However, the next big opportunity for the company could be with its Microsoft 365 Copilot. The company recently introduced a number of improved Copilots for Microsoft 365, which it will use to help lure organizations to its Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on. With these new features, users will be able to do things like work with the programming language Python in Excel through only natural language, pull in data from different types of sources with Word Copilot, and create presentations using only natural language with Copilot for Powerpoint. At the cost of $30 a month per user for its Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on, this is a huge potential growth opportunity for Microsoft, as its 365 Copilot costs more than many of its subscriptions to Microsoft 365. To purchase the Microsoft Copilot, users are required to have a separate license to a qualifying plan, which can range from as little as $4.75 per user per month for its basic business plan without Teams to $22 per user per month for its premium business subscription with Teams, which also includes cybersecurity and identity management features. Some enterprise plans with more features can cost more. Microsoft has proven to be an adaptive and innovative company, which has helped it grow to be one of the largest companies in the world. It is these attributes, along with the AI opportunity in front of it, that make it a great long-term investment. Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Here's How Much You Have to Invest in Microsoft Stock",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/19/want-1000-in-dividend-income-heres-how-much-you-ha/,"Microsoft may not offer the biggest dividend, but its impressive dividend streak is worth watching.

Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) just gave investors a reason to smile by cranking up its quarterly dividend payout by nearly 11% in September. But this isn't exactly a surprise. Microsoft has been paying dividends since 2003 and has consistently upped those payouts for nearly two decades.

Granted, most investors tend to focus on Microsoft's impressive growth story and its big bets on artificial intelligence (AI) -- and that makes sense. But you might still be curious about just how much you can earn in dividends if you own this stock.

With a current dividend yield of around 0.8%, Microsoft is far from being the highest-yielding option out there. Still, it offers a steady stream of income alongside its growth potential.

Your first $1000 in dividend income from Microsoft

When investing in dividend-paying assets, a common milestone to shoot for is earning your first $1,000 in dividend income. Let's run the numbers for Microsoft.

Microsoft recently bumped its quarterly dividend from $0.75 per share to $0.83 per share. That comes out to $3.32 annually. To earn $1,000 a year in dividends, you'd need to own about 302 shares. At Microsoft's current share price of around $417, you'd need to invest about $126,000 to reach your goal.

Is it worth it? Maybe not if you're strictly chasing high yields. But if you're looking for long-term growth potential and steady dividend hikes, Microsoft could be worth considering. Its heavy investments in AI might pressure earnings now, but they could drive major growth down the road. Plus, with a market cap of over $3 trillion and a spot among the ""Magnificent Seven,"" you'd own a stake in one of the largest companies in the world.

Do your research and listen to the earnings calls to get a sense of where Microsoft is headed. And if you want to lock in the next dividend payout, make sure to grab shares before the ex-dividend date on Nov. 21 to secure your quarterly check in December.",MSFT,yes,eod,436

More specifically, Microsoft stock has delivered just 11% gains this year, underperforming the S&P 500 index by a big margin. The stock's underperformance may seem a tad surprising considering that it has been clocking healthy growth quarter after quarter. In this article, we will take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects for the next three years and check if the tech giant can overcome a disappointing 2024 to become a long-term winner.

AI has the potential to lift Microsoft's growth significantly

Microsoft's revenue in the recently concluded fiscal year 2024 (which ended on June 30) increased by 15% year over year in constant-currency terms to $245 billion. This healthy double-digit growth was driven by the growing demand for the company's Microsoft 365 office collaboration and productivity tools, an impressive jump in its Azure revenue, and a 9% jump in search and news-advertising revenue.

The Azure business was the cornerstone of Microsoft's growth in fiscal 2024. It recorded a 33% year-over-year increase in revenue from Azure and other cloud-services last year, of which nine percentage points were attributable to artificial intelligence (AI). It is worth noting that AI's contribution to Microsoft's Azure business increased throughout the year, jumping from five percentage points in the fiscal first quarter to 11 percentage points in fiscal Q4.

It is easy to see why Microsoft's Azure cloud service is getting a nice shot in the arm thanks to AI. After all, the demand for cloud-based AI services is growing at an incredible pace. Goldman Sachs estimates that the global cloud-computing market could generate $2 trillion in revenue by 2030 as compared to $496 billion in 2023. More importantly, generative AI is expected to account for 10% to 15% of global-cloud spending by the end of the decade.

Microsoft is already capitalizing on this lucrative trend by giving customers access to a big pool of large language models (LLMs) on its cloud platform with which they can develop and deploy AI models. As CEO Satya Nadella remarked on the July earnings-conference call:

Microsoft also points out that its models-as-a-service offering has also gained impressive traction, with the number of paid customers doubling quarter over quarter in fiscal Q4. The tech giant offers customers access to various kinds of models on rent so that they can develop and deploy AI applications. So, with the demand for AI services in the cloud set to grow substantially in the coming years, Microsoft should ideally witness further acceleration in its Azure revenue. On the other hand, Microsoft's Office 365 business is also getting a nice lift thanks to AI. According to Nadella, ""the number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter over quarter"" in fiscal Q4, with the number of customers using Copilot jumping 60% sequentially. Microsoft Copilot is a generative AI assistant that allows users to ""complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings and automate business workflows and processes."" Again, this could be a potentially lucrative market for Microsoft as the market for AI-powered productivity tools is expected to grow at an annual rate of almost 27% through the end of the decade, according to Grand View Research. The size of the market was worth an estimated $6.9 billion last year, but it could hit $36 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade. In all, the emergence of new growth opportunities for Microsoft thanks to AI should ideally help the company sustain its healthy levels of growth over the next three years. This is precisely what consensus estimates suggest, as the chart below shows. MSFT Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts. Stronger earnings growth could send the stock on a nice bull run Microsoft reported a 20% year-over-year jump in non-GAAP earnings in fiscal 2024 to $11.80 per share. Though analysts are forecasting a smaller jump in the current fiscal year, Microsoft's earnings growth is expected to pick up pace in fiscal years 2026 and 2027. The smaller increase in Microsoft's fiscal 2025 earnings can be attributed to the company's aggressive capital spending. Last year, Microsoft's capital expenditure jumped 75% from the preceding year to $55.7 billion, and it is on track to increase its capex once again in fiscal 2025 thanks to its focus on building out its cloud and AI infrastructure. While the elevated levels of spending will weigh on Microsoft's bottom-line growth in the short run, the company believes that it should help it monetize the growing demand for AI over the next 15 years and longer. That's why investors would do well to look at the bigger picture. Moreover, it's clear that Microsoft's earnings growth is forecasted to accelerate over the next couple of years. Assuming its earnings indeed jump to $17.98 per share in fiscal 2027 and it trades at 30 times earnings at that time -- in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's price-to-earnings ratio -- its stock price could hit $540. That would represent a 29% jump from current levels. However, if Microsoft is able to achieve stronger levels of growth and the market decides to reward it with a higher-earnings multiple, it could deliver stronger gains over the next three years. So, investors would do well to add this tech giant to their portfolios even though it has underperformed so far in 2024 as its AI-fueled growth could help it step on the gas.

With improved access to OpenAI's AI platform, the app is available to Plus, Enterprise, Team, and Edu customers.

Downloading the Windows software adds to the macOS version for testing purposes. Enterprise is meant for larger enterprises; the Team version though is suited for shared workspaces. Moreover, with AI-driven technologies, ChatGPT Edu seeks to help academics, teachers, staff, and administrators.

Faster response times and the option to design custom GPTs are just two out of a whole host of benefits of ChatGPT Plus, a $20 monthly membership plan offered over the free edition. This most recent addition is a result of OpenAI's continuous endeavor to increase accessibility by spreading its AI tools over other platforms. It's important to note that Microsoft has been a massive beneficiary of OpenAI's surge, positioning it as one of the bellwethers in the AI space.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corps Portfolio

The recent reduction in Xencor Inc shares by State Street Corp reflects a strategic adjustment in their investment approach, possibly due to the stock's current overvaluation and the company's financial health.

The firm opted to reduce its holdings by 34,397 shares, priced at $2.15 each. Following this transaction, State Street Corp's total share count in W&T Offshore stands at 2,570,385, marking a notable adjustment in its investment portfolio.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent financial services provider with a robust focus on investment management. The firm manages a diverse portfolio across various sectors, with a significant emphasis on technology and financial services. Its top holdings include major corporations such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). State Street Corp is known for its strategic investment decisions aimed at long-term value creation.

W&T Offshore Inc specializes in the exploration and production of oil and gas, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. The company's operations include both deepwater and shallow-water drilling. Despite its focused business model, W&T Offshore's financial metrics indicate challenges, with a current market capitalization of $310.158 million and a GF Value suggesting the stock might be a possible value trap. The firm's performance metrics such as a GF Score of 55/100 and a profitability rank of 5/10 reflect its mid-range market standing.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio

The recent reduction in W&T Offshore shares by State Street Corp has minimally impacted its vast portfolio, given the firm's extensive holdings across various sectors. However, this move adjusts its exposure to the energy sector, aligning with potential strategic shifts or risk management considerations. The transaction did not significantly alter the firm's position in W&T Offshore, maintaining a 1.80% holding ratio.

W&T Offshore's stock performance has been underwhelming, with a year-to-date decline of 35.03% and a significant drop of 89.21% since its IPO. Other notable investors like Fisher Asset Management and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) also hold stakes in W&T Offshore, each employing distinct strategies concerning their holdings in the energy sector.

The decision by State Street Corp to reduce its stake in W&T Offshore may reflect broader market trends or specific challenges within the oil and gas industry. This strategic move could be indicative of the firm's risk assessment and portfolio rebalancing efforts, aiming to optimize returns amidst fluctuating market conditions. State Street Corp's recent transaction involving W&T Offshore Inc shares represents a strategic portfolio adjustment rather than a significant shift. This action provides insights into the firm's ongoing strategy to navigate the complexities of the energy market, balancing risk and opportunity. As market conditions evolve, the implications of such transactions will continue to influence both the firm's portfolio dynamics and the broader investment landscape in the oil and gas sector.

This transaction, executed at a price of $53.11 per share, increased State Street Corp's total holdings in Universal Corp to 1,218,793 shares, marking a notable expansion in its stake.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent financial services provider known for its robust investment strategies. With a portfolio that includes top holdings in major technology and financial services companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), State Street Corp manages an equity portfolio valued at approximately $2,285.63 trillion. The firm's investment philosophy emphasizes substantial market presence and diversified global investments, particularly in the technology and financial sectors.

Universal Corp, listed under the symbol UVV, operates primarily through its Tobacco and Ingredients segments, with the majority of its revenue generated in the United States. Since its IPO on January 4, 1988, the company has not manufactured consumer products directly but focuses on processing and supplying leaf tobacco. As of the latest data, Universal Corp is modestly undervalued with a GF Value of $64.45 and a market capitalization of $1.25 billion.

The acquisition by State Street Corp involved 71,773 additional shares of Universal Corp, bringing their total ownership to 1,218,793 shares, which represents a 4.90% stake in the company. This move is strategic, considering the current market valuation and the intrinsic value indicated by the GF Value, suggesting a potential undervaluation of Universal Corp's stock.

Since the transaction, Universal Corp's stock has seen a price decrease of 4.8%, with a year-to-date decline of 24.74%. Despite these figures, the long-term growth potential remains, supported by a GF Score of 78/100, indicating a likelihood of average to above-average performance. The largest shareholder of Universal Corp remains Pzena Investment Management LLC, highlighting the competitive interest in the stock among institutional investors.

The decision by State Street Corp to increase its stake in Universal Corp aligns with its broader portfolio strategy, focusing on sectors with substantial growth and return potential. The tobacco industry, despite facing regulatory and societal challenges, continues to offer investment opportunities, particularly in segments like leaf tobacco supply where Universal operates.

The broader economic factors and the specific dynamics of the tobacco industry play a crucial role in shaping investment strategies like those of State Street Corp. With its strategic acquisitions and diversified portfolio, State Street Corp is well-positioned to leverage both sector-specific and economic trends to optimize its investment returns.

2024-10-18T17:57:02+00:00,Utilities outperform the broader markets amid enthusiasm over AI electricity demand,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/utilities-outperform-the-broader-markets-amid-enthusiasm-over-ai-electricity-demand-175702728.html,"Utilities have been on fire this year as enthusiasm over booming AI electricity demand pushes the sector higher.

Case in point: The S&P 500 Utilities ETF (XLU) is up a whopping 29% so far this year — the best-performing sector to date, compared to the broader index's 23% rise.

Much of the gains stem from enthusiasm over power producers that stand to benefit from the electrification boom — which includes Big Tech's massive appetite for AI data centers and electric vehicles.

By 2050, electricity is projected to become the largest source of energy worldwide, according to a recent McKinsey study.

Also, five of the top 10 returning companies in the S&P 500 this year have been energy companies, noted Matt Sallee, president of Tortoise Capital. “Utilities and midstream infrastructure are going to be secondary beneficiaries of the AI theme,” he said in a recent note.

There’s no better example of that investor fever than the S&P 500's top performer this year, power producer Vistra Corp (VST).

Shares of the Irving, Texas-based company are up 243% year to date, outperforming even AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), up 186% during the same period.

On Thursday, JPMorgan analysts initiated coverage of Vistra along with two other Wall Street favorites, Talen Energy (TLN) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — all with an Overweight rating,

The analysts said the independent power producers (IPPs) stand to benefit from ""a paradigm shift in power demand"" amid structural tailwinds like manufacturing on-shoring, electrification trends, and data-center development.

""We do not see competitive market supply growth matching this demand, enabling IPPs to capture outsized margins for an extended period of time,"" wrote JPMorgan's Jeremy Tonet and his team.

As Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman pointed out, recent headlines like Microsoft (MSFT) teaming up with Constellation Energy to restart a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island, and Amazon (AMZN) buying up a data center campus from Talen Energy have put Big Tech and its insatiable need for electricity into the spotlight.

But XLU's massive performance this year begs the question — has it topped?

With the broader markets at all-time highs, it may be a good idea to keep investing in defensive stocks like utilities that provide dividends, said Burns McKinney, managing director and senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group.

“There does seem to be a little bit more meat on the bone,” said McKinney, referring to more growth ahead.

If XLU holds its 29.1% year-to-date gains, it will be the best-ever yearly performance for the sector.",MSFT,yes,eod,553
2024-10-18T17:08:16+00:00,Microsoft and OpenAI are haggling over the tech giant’s stake in the startup,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-openai-haggling-over-tech-170816471.html,"Microsoft and OpenAI may be working on a decidedly newfangled technology, but they’re haggling over an age-old business question: How much equity should I get for my investment?

The two companies each hired investment banks to help answer how Microsoft’s roughly $13.75 billion worth of investments in OpenAI since 2019 will translate after the startup converts from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation, according to the Wall Street Journal.

OpenAI hired Goldman Sachs to advise it during the process, and Microsoft brought on Morgan Stanley, the Journal reported. The two blue-chip banks will now have to help their clients, who have deep ties, navigate a thorny financial question as they determine how much of OpenAI will be owned by Microsoft.

Microsoft and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. OpenAI and Goldman Sachs did not respond to a request for comment.

The negotiations over Microsoft’s ownership stake come as OpenAI’s valuation has soared.

The developer behind ChatGPT was valued at $157 billion after it closed a round of funding earlier this month. Investors in that round included the chipmaker Nvidia, venture capital firm Thrive Capital, and Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank. In January 2023, just a few months after the November 2022 release of ChatGPT-3, Microsoft made a massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI that valued the startup at $86 billion.

Meanwhile, OpenAI is still unprofitable and projects a $5 billion loss this year on $3.7 billion in revenue. Yet OpenAI expects to see extraordinary growth, with its top line ballooning to $11.6 billion next year, according to internal company estimates reported by the New York Times.

Under OpenAI’s nonprofit status, Microsoft’s investment entitled it to a portion of the profits generated from a for-profit subsidiary that was run by the board of OpenAI. The for-profit subsidiary was originally structured to cap the profits it could reap. Microsoft’s portion of the cap was also capped at a certain level.

In September, Reuters reported that OpenAI intends to restructure itself into a for-profit public benefit company, a special designation that would allow it to commit itself to goals meant to better society as well as return value to shareholders.

The nonprofit will still exist, although it won’t continue to be the entity under which the new for-profit version of OpenAI operates. The nonprofit will still own a minority stake in the new for-profit version of the company. The move was made in an effort to make the company more attractive to investors, who presumably are eagerly lining up to make offers for a stake in the company synonymous with the AI revolution.

As part of its restructuring, OpenAI will also give CEO Sam Altman equity in the company. Altman previously said he had a “tiny bit of exposure via the YC investment,” referring to Y Combinator, the legendary startup accelerator of which he was the president. In this newly formed company Altman, and other leaders, would likely be granted a much larger share, as is common practice for executives. At a companywide meeting in September, Altman said there were no plans for him to get a “giant equity stake” in OpenAI after earlier reports said that he might receive as much as 7% of the company. At the same meeting, Altman and OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar mentioned that investors had raised concerns about Altman not having a stake in the company he was leading. Microsoft will also likely seek to negotiate the extent of its governance rights in OpenAI. When OpenAI’s board briefly fired Altman in November 2023, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was caught off guard by the decision, despite the company’s massive investments in OpenAI. In a series of media appearances following Altman’s reinstatement, Nadella reiterated Microsoft’s commitment to OpenAI but hinted that he would want greater say in its corporate governance. “At this point, I think it’s very clear that something has to change around the governance,” Nadella told CNBC in November 2023, as Altman’s ouster was unfolding.

2024-10-18T17:02:06+00:00,State Street Corp's Strategic Adjustment in Nabors Industries Ltd Holdings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corps-strategic-adjustment-170206869.html,"On September 30, 2024, State Street Corp executed a significant transaction involving the shares of Nabors Industries Ltd (NYSE:NBR), a prominent player in the oil and gas industry. The firm reduced its holdings by 2,315 shares, which adjusted its total share count to 415,573. Despite this reduction, the transaction had a minimal direct impact on the firm's portfolio, maintaining a 4.40% holding ratio in Nabors Industries Ltd. The shares were traded at a price of $64.47.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a major institutional investor known for its strategic investment decisions. The firm manages a diverse portfolio with a significant emphasis on technology and financial services sectors. Its top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), showcasing a strong inclination towards high-performing tech stocks. The firm's investment philosophy focuses on leveraging market trends and technological advancements to maximize returns.

Nabors Industries Ltd, based in Bermuda, operates one of the largest land-based drilling rig fleets globally. Since its IPO on February 28, 1991, the company has expanded its services to include performance tools, directional drilling, and innovative technologies, with operations spanning over 15 countries. The company's business is segmented into U.S. Drilling, Canada Drilling, International Drilling, Drilling Solutions, and Rig Technologies, with a significant revenue contribution from its international drilling operations.

Financial and Market Analysis of Nabors Industries Ltd

Currently, Nabors Industries Ltd holds a market capitalization of approximately $676.71 million, with a recent stock price of $70.87. The stock is considered a possible value trap according to the GF Value, which suggests a cautious approach due to its current price to GF Value ratio of 0.59. Despite a year-to-date price decrease of 12.35%, the stock has shown a gain of 9.93% since the recent transaction by State Street Corp. The company's financial strength and profitability are areas of concern, with a GF Score of 62/100, indicating poor future performance potential.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corps Portfolio

The recent reduction in Nabors Industries Ltd shares by State Street Corp reflects a strategic portfolio adjustment rather than a significant shift. This move aligns with the firm's broader investment strategy, which heavily favors technology and financial sectors, suggesting a reallocation of resources to potentially higher yield areas.

State Street Corp's investment focus remains robust in technology and financial services, sectors that are pivotal to its overall strategy. This strategic focus is evident from its top holdings and the substantial equity managed within these sectors, amounting to $2,285.63 trillion. Other notable investors in Nabors Industries Ltd include Gotham Asset Management, LLC, which holds a significant share percentage, making it one of the largest shareholders. Comparatively, State Street Corp's holdings represent a strategic but not dominant investment within its diversified portfolio. Given the challenging financial metrics and market performance of Nabors Industries Ltd, State Street Corp's decision to reduce its stake might be a prudent move. The future performance of Nabors will likely hinge on improvements in its operational and financial efficiencies, areas currently reflected as underwhelming in its GF Scores and financial rankings. As the market dynamics evolve, State Street Corp's adept adjustments in its investment portfolio will be crucial in maintaining its strong market position, especially in its favored sectors.

2024-10-18T15:01:58+00:00,State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc Shares,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corps-strategic-acquisition-150158066.html,"On September 30, 2024, State Street Corp made a significant addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 1,688,156 shares of John Wiley & Sons Inc (NYSE:WLY). This transaction, executed at a price of $48.25 per share, marks a notable increase in State Street Corp's holdings in the company, reflecting a strategic move to bolster its position in the media-diversified industry.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent financial services provider with a robust investment philosophy focused on delivering sustainable returns. The firm manages a diverse portfolio with top holdings in major companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), predominantly in the technology and financial services sectors. With an equity portfolio valued at approximately $2.29 trillion, State Street Corp is a significant player in the investment community.

John Wiley & Sons Inc, trading under the symbol WLY, is a leading provider of academic publishing and online education management solutions. Since its IPO on March 26, 1990, the company has grown to achieve a market capitalization of $2.75 billion. WLY operates through segments such as Research, Learning, and Held for Sale or Sold, with the Research segment being the most significant revenue contributor. The company's headquarters are in the United States, with substantial operations across the United Kingdom, China, Japan, and Canada.

The recent acquisition by State Street Corp has increased its total shareholding in WLY to 1,688,156 shares, representing a 3.70% position in its portfolio. This move not only diversifies State Street Corp's investments but also strengthens its influence in the media-diversified sector. Despite the trade's zero impact on the portfolio's overall percentage, the strategic nature of this acquisition could hint at State Street Corp's positive outlook on WLY's future performance.

At the time of the transaction, WLY was trading at $50.66, which is significantly overvalued according to the GF Value of $38.21. The stock has shown a remarkable year-to-date increase of 62.11% and an impressive growth of 7815.63% since its IPO. These metrics suggest a strong market confidence in WLY, despite its current valuation challenges.

John Wiley & Sons Inc exhibits a mixed financial health with a Financial Strength rank of 5/10 and a Profitability Rank of 6/10. The company's growth metrics are concerning, with a Growth Rank of 1/10, indicating potential challenges in expanding its market reach and revenue base. However, its strong momentum rank of 9/10 suggests short-term investment attractiveness. The media-diversified industry is highly competitive, with companies constantly innovating to capture larger market shares. WLY's strategic focus on academic and educational publishing sets it apart, providing a niche advantage. However, comparing its performance with industry standards shows that while WLY holds a strong position in certain aspects, there are areas of improvement, particularly in growth and profitability. The increased stake by State Street Corp in WLY could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's strategic direction and market potential.

The survey’s findings revealed improved performance and outlooks across the sector, leading the firm to increase its estimates and target prices for Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), Cyberark Software Ltd (NASDAQ:CYBR), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Specifically, meets and beets from the respondents improved to 75%, up from a dismal 45% and 50% in the previous two years, KeyBanc analysts said in a Thursday note.

When it comes to 2024 IT budgets, analysts noted “a slight uptick in growth expectations, but the bigger increase came in 2025 IT budget expectations, which this group now forecasts to accelerate to 4.4% compared to a 3.2% expectation 90 days ago.”

“37% of VARs expect to see an IT budget recovery in the first half of 2025. That is an uptick from last quarter and, importantly, begins in just a couple months, meaning the visibility is higher than it was previously,” the note writes.

Security-specific meets and beats remained steady at 80%, consistent with the last quarter.

As a result of the survey, KeyBanc raised its price targets for several stocks. Palo Alto Networks saw its target increase to $435 from $376.15, CyberArk’s target was lifted to $340 from $295.65, and Microsoft’s target was raised to $505 from $416.72.

Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), although not receiving a price target change, benefited from improved meets and beats, positioning it as the top-performing security vendor this quarter.

KeyBanc also raised its estimates for these companies, citing strong demand for cybersecurity solutions, particularly in endpoint protection, firewall refresh cycles, and identity and access management.

""Firewall refresh expectations upticked, with 41% of respondents expecting improvement or activity in the next six months, up from 30% last survey,"" noted the firm, which is seen as a positive driver for vendors like Palo Alto and Fortinet.

Despite some macroeconomic challenges, KeyBanc remains optimistic about the sector, with cybersecurity budget growth forecasted to accelerate. The firm expects security spending to grow by 11.7% in 2024 and accelerate to 14.4% in 2025.

The survey also revealed that 26% of respondents noticed slight improvement in the macro environment compared to the previous quarter, a rise from 16%. However, 74% have not observed or anticipate any recovery in IT spending for the rest of 2024.

Looking ahead, 37% foresee a recovery in the first half of 2025, while another 37% expect it to occur later. The U.S. election is affecting decision-making for 26% of respondents, with many reporting delayed projects and a ""wait and see"" stance.",MSFT,yes,eod,612

Earlier this year, Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) released separate reports showing that neither company is on track to meet its climate goals by the end of the decade. They both blamed the same culprit: data centers.

Despite the environmental toll, experts say data and other artificial intelligence infrastructure will be the winners of AI’s next phase as companies seek to power their growing AI offerings.

While AI chips developed by companies such as Nvidia and AMD are crucial to the current phase of AI development, the broader data center industry is “very well positioned” to be at the center of the next phase of AI expansion, Tejas Dessai, director of research at Global X, told Quartz.



“Where I think you have the highest probability of naming winners is in the picks and shovels category — who’s building the infrastructure that’s going to power all this,” Rowan Trollope, chief executive of data platform Redis, told Quartz. “No matter who, what app, or what model wins, we sit in the middle and we make them all better.”

As companies deploy more AI clusters, there could be “an uptake in memory solutions, in storage solutions, in networking solutions,” Dessai said, followed by companies specialized in comprehensive data center solutions.

“Currently, the principle that many of these companies are operating with is: The more the number of chips that we can put together in terms of training these models, the smarter and smarter the outcome is that we can get out of these models,” Dessai said in a separate interview with Quartz.

But he says there are still “a lot of physical constraints” such as GPU clusters, which run on hundreds of thousands of chips. And data centers can take years to come online, meaning there is still some “running behind” when it comes to having enough capacity for AI workloads.

“We’re still very early in that cycle and you see companies like OpenAI trying to get access to data center capacity from anywhere and everywhere that they can find it,” Dessai said.

Sarah Friar, chief technology officer at OpenAI, reportedly told the startup’s shareholders that its partner and investor, Microsoft, was too slow at supplying it with enough computing power. After the company completed its $6.6 billion funding round, the startup’s leaders told some employees that it would start leaning less on Microsoft for data centers and AI chips, according to The Information, which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.

In the short to medium term, Dessai said he sees data centers remaining attractive to companies as construction increases and vacancy rates reach “an all-time low.”

“Companies are really wanting to buy pretty much any capacity that they can find their hands on,” Dessai said.

“Data is the big winning category,” Trollope said. “We don’t know who in the data category is going to win, but I think the incumbents have a really good shot.”

Microsoft, which set a goal in 2020 to be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade, said in May that its carbon emissions are almost 31% higher than when it set the commitment. The increase was mostly due to building data centers, it said, as well as hardware like semiconductors and servers.

Meanwhile, Google said in July that its carbon emissions have risen by 48% since 2019, and were up 13% year-over-year in 2023 — mostly because of data center energy consumption. The tech giant set a goal in 2021 to reach net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030.

By the end of the decade, data centers could consume up to 9% of electricity in the U.S. — more than double what is being used now, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

In April, Ami Badani, chief marketing officer of British chip designer Arm, said data centers powering AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT account for 2% of global electricity consumption. One query on ChatGPT needs almost 10 times as much electricity as a Google search, according to a study by Goldman Sachs (GS). That level of energy demand, Badani said, could eventually slow down AI progress.

Tech giants are seemingly taking note of this obstacle. In July, the Wall Street Journal reported that a third of the U.S.’s nuclear power plants were discussing deals with tech companies to supply electricity for data centers.

“We have to make up for this energy deficit in one way or another,” Dessai said. “We can’t burn more coal, we can’t use more fossil fuels. So naturally nuclear energy becomes the answer to it.”

As big tech seems to be moving toward nuclear energy, “we’ll continue to see more deals in that direction,” he said.

Earlier this week, Google announced that it was signing “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy” from Small Modular Reactors, or SMRs, developed by California-based Kairos Power.

Google said it expects to bring Kairos Power’s first SMR online by the end of the decade, and others are planned through 2035. Through the deal, 500 megawatts (MW) of 24/7 carbon-free power will be available to U.S. electricity grids.

Amazon (AMZN) also signed agreements this week “to support the development of nuclear energy projects,” including by building “several” SMRs which have “a smaller physical footprint, allowing them to be built closer to the grid,” the company said. Compared to traditional reactors, the smaller SMRs can come online faster due to lower construction time, according to Amazon.

In September, Constellation Energy (CEG), which owns most of the country’s power plants, announced a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft. The deal will restart the Unit 1 reactor on Three Mile Island, and launch the Crane Clean Energy Center. The CCEC, which is expected to come online by 2028, will add more than 800 MW of carbon-free electricity to the power grid, a study by the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council found.

2024-10-18T00:00:00+00:00,What Is a Data Center?,https://www.fool.com/terms/d/data-center/,"The investing community is abuzz about data centers, particularly as they relate to artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. Get up to speed with this review of the role data centers play in the technology ecosystem and five ways you can invest in data center growth.

Data centers are physical facilities that house technology components. Those components include servers, storage systems, networking switches and routers, backup power sources, and controls to manage the facility's temperature and humidity. Together, this equipment supports data storage, data processing, network connectivity, and other technology functions. Before the advent of cloud computing, data centers were privately owned and located in or near business operations. Known as on-premise data centers, these facilities were owned, maintained, and managed by organizations with computing needs. A small law office might have had servers in a closet, for example. A global enterprise, on the other hand, may have had entire floors occupied by mainframe computers and related equipment.

Today, organizations have three additional options for securing the technology infrastructure they need.
• Managed data centers. The company leases dedicated equipment in a data center and outsources the technology management.
• Colocation facilities. The company leases space from the data center to house the equipment it owns. In this arrangement, the company is usually responsible for maintenance.
• Cloud computing. The company subscribes to public, shared services from a cloud computing provider such as Amazon ( ), Microsoft ( ), or Alphabet ( ). The company accesses the infrastructure remotely and has no physical access to the facility. The cloud computing model has advantages that are primarily related to efficiency and scalability. Customers do not have to allocate resources for buying and managing technology infrastructure. They can also scale their cloud usage as needed, rather than having to buy more hardware as they expand. Also, since the major cloud providers are always working to remain competitive, they keep their cloud services updated to support the latest computing needs. Those needs are evolving quickly as machine learning and quantum computing technologies mature. Developing and launching a large language model, for example, requires high-performance hardware and a robust software stack. For most businesses, it is vastly cheaper and easier to access these from the cloud vs. building a privately owned facility. Grand View Research has projected that the data center market will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9% between 2023 and 2030. The ongoing increase in digital and online activities is a primary growth driver. As businesses and consumers increase their online activities, demand also rises for scalability and efficiency in data storage, compute resources, and cybersecurity protocols. There are growth constraints for data centers, however. One that's significant is the related limitations of space and power. Larger data centers can be space- and cost-efficient, but they generate more heat, so they require more power to cool. That raises operational costs and can leave less power available for computing. Facility operators can ease the space-power conflict by building in cool climates and making greater use of renewable energy sources. Technology provider Juniper Networks (JNPR -0.2%) predicts that data centers will increasingly implement solar, wind, and hydropower as well as low-power cooling methods like liquid immersion.

Five ways to invest in data centers The trends reveal several different ways to invest in data center growth. Five options include:
• Hardware providers. Nvidia ( ), the leader in AI chips, has experienced extraordinary growth in demand for its data center products. Micron ( ) is also benefitting from data center growth. The company supplies data center servers, storage, and memory solutions.
• Power providers. Utility company CMS Energy ( ) recently secured a power contract with a Michigan data center. According to Reuters, other utilities have also said they're seeing earnings rise from data center demand. Solar panel manufacturer First Solar ( ) has acknowledged the trend as well.
• Cloud providers. The three dominant cloud providers are Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet.
• Data center real estate investment trusts (REITs). Iron Mountain ( ), Equinix ( ), and Digital Realty Trust Inc ( ) are three REITs that own data centers around the world. Investors looking to gain from data center growth can hold these and similar stocks individually. A more manageable solution, however, might be a themed ETF. Options include Pacer Benchmark Data and Infrastructure Real Estate SCTR ETF (SRVR 1.36%) and Global X Data Center & Digital Infrastructure ETF (VPN 1.03%). Relative to individual stocks, data center ETFs have the advantage of being diversified, which may contribute to lower risk and volatility.

2024-10-18T00:00:00+00:00,Where Will Microsoft Stock Be in 3 Years?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/18/where-will-microsoft-stock-be-in-3-years/,"Microsoft's AI-powered growth should help the stock regain its mojo following a disappointing 2024.

Shares of Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) have delivered steady gains of 41% in the past three years, edging the S&P 500 index's jump of 34% by a small margin, but the world's third-largest company by market cap has failed to gather any steam in 2024.

More specifically, Microsoft stock has delivered just 11% gains this year, underperforming the S&P 500 index by a big margin. The stock's underperformance may seem a tad surprising considering that it has been clocking healthy growth quarter after quarter. In this article, we will take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects for the next three years and check if the tech giant can overcome a disappointing 2024 to become a long-term winner.

AI has the potential to lift Microsoft's growth significantly

Microsoft's revenue in the recently concluded fiscal year 2024 (which ended on June 30) increased by 15% year over year in constant-currency terms to $245 billion. This healthy double-digit growth was driven by the growing demand for the company's Microsoft 365 office collaboration and productivity tools, an impressive jump in its Azure revenue, and a 9% jump in search and news-advertising revenue.

The Azure business was the cornerstone of Microsoft's growth in fiscal 2024. It recorded a 33% year-over-year increase in revenue from Azure and other cloud-services last year, of which nine percentage points were attributable to artificial intelligence (AI). It is worth noting that AI's contribution to Microsoft's Azure business increased throughout the year, jumping from five percentage points in the fiscal first quarter to 11 percentage points in fiscal Q4.

It is easy to see why Microsoft's Azure cloud service is getting a nice shot in the arm thanks to AI. After all, the demand for cloud-based AI services is growing at an incredible pace. Goldman Sachs estimates that the global cloud-computing market could generate $2 trillion in revenue by 2030 as compared to $496 billion in 2023. More importantly, generative AI is expected to account for 10% to 15% of global-cloud spending by the end of the decade.

Microsoft is already capitalizing on this lucrative trend by giving customers access to a big pool of large language models (LLMs) on its cloud platform with which they can develop and deploy AI models. As CEO Satya Nadella remarked on the July earnings-conference call:

Microsoft also points out that its models-as-a-service offering has also gained impressive traction, with the number of paid customers doubling quarter over quarter in fiscal Q4. The tech giant offers customers access to various kinds of models on rent so that they can develop and deploy AI applications. So, with the demand for AI services in the cloud set to grow substantially in the coming years, Microsoft should ideally witness further acceleration in its Azure revenue.

On the other hand, Microsoft's Office 365 business is also getting a nice lift thanks to AI. According to Nadella, ""the number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter over quarter"" in fiscal Q4, with the number of customers using Copilot jumping 60% sequentially. Microsoft Copilot is a generative AI assistant that allows users to ""complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings and automate business workflows and processes.""

Again, this could be a potentially lucrative market for Microsoft as the market for AI-powered productivity tools is expected to grow at an annual rate of almost 27% through the end of the decade, according to Grand View Research. The size of the market was worth an estimated $6.9 billion last year, but it could hit $36 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade.

In all, the emergence of new growth opportunities for Microsoft thanks to AI should ideally help the company sustain its healthy levels of growth over the next three years. This is precisely what consensus estimates suggest, as the chart below shows.

MSFT Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts.

Stronger earnings growth could send the stock on a nice bull run

Microsoft reported a 20% year-over-year jump in non-GAAP earnings in fiscal 2024 to $11.80 per share. Though analysts are forecasting a smaller jump in the current fiscal year, Microsoft's earnings growth is expected to pick up pace in fiscal years 2026 and 2027.

The smaller increase in Microsoft's fiscal 2025 earnings can be attributed to the company's aggressive capital spending. Last year, Microsoft's capital expenditure jumped 75% from the preceding year to $55.7 billion, and it is on track to increase its capex once again in fiscal 2025 thanks to its focus on building out its cloud and AI infrastructure.

While the elevated levels of spending will weigh on Microsoft's bottom-line growth in the short run, the company believes that it should help it monetize the growing demand for AI over the next 15 years and longer. That's why investors would do well to look at the bigger picture.

Moreover, it's clear that Microsoft's earnings growth is forecasted to accelerate over the next couple of years. Assuming its earnings indeed jump to $17.98 per share in fiscal 2027 and it trades at 30 times earnings at that time -- in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's price-to-earnings ratio -- its stock price could hit $540. That would represent a 29% jump from current levels.

However, if Microsoft is able to achieve stronger levels of growth and the market decides to reward it with a higher-earnings multiple, it could deliver stronger gains over the next three years. So, investors would do well to add this tech giant to their portfolios even though it has underperformed so far in 2024 as its AI-fueled growth could help it step on the gas.",MSFT,yes,eod,1204

Other notable investors in Diamondback Energy include Yacktman Asset Management (Trades, Portfolio). While State Street Corp's stake is significant, it is essential to compare these holdings with other major investors to gauge market sentiment and potential sector movements. Diamondback Energy's future performance potential appears promising, with a GF Score of 92/100, indicating a high potential for outperformance. The stock has also shown a year-to-date price increase of 17.16%, with historical growth trends suggesting continued upward momentum. These indicators are crucial for investors looking to capitalize on robust earnings growth and solid market positioning in the evolving energy sector. In conclusion, State Street Corp's recent acquisition of Diamondback Energy shares is a strategic enhancement to its portfolio, reflecting a well-rounded approach to investment that balances immediate value with long-term growth prospects. This move is likely to influence the firm's market standing and financial performance positively, aligning with its broader investment objectives.

2024-10-17T22:35:10+00:00,Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-most-promising-223510854.html,"We recently compiled a list of 10 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we will look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.

Another 50 bps Cut is Still Restrictive

The labor market has been more resilient than ever. On October 4, Gary Cohn, the IBM vice chairman, and former US National Economic Council director in the Trump administration, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the job report and the US economy.

Cohn suggests that the jobs data is the least scientific information the government puts out and therefore, it must be taken with a grain of salt. However, he emphasizes the importance of understanding trends. The number of people entering the workforce is expanding and jobs are being created, deducing that the market is in a neutral place.

Cohn believes that the US economy is normalizing. He reveals that we have not lived in a normal economy in over a decade, therefore, relative to history, the status quo is fairly reasonable. He adds that the Fed has orchestrated a soft landing and expects another 50 basis point cut before the end of 2024, which according to him is still restrictive.

As the AI flame starts to settle, the market may be up for a major shift. On October 7, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his expectations of the market.

Expectations for earnings have been revised from mid-single digits to mid-double digitals, promising robust growth as 2024 comes to a close. Buchanan suggests that most of the growth comes from artificial intelligence and the widening of earnings growth beyond traditional growth sectors like technology.

This year, the industrial and energy sectors have enjoyed greater returns capturing a large chunk of the market. Buchanan is highly bullish on AI plays and value stocks. He also adds that names in financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary are poised for growth ahead of 2024. He advises investors to consider geopolitical events before making any investment decisions.

Now that we have assessed the future of the financial markets and possible sectors eyeing growth, let’s take a look at the 10 most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.

To find the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds, we went over multiple rankings over the internet to list long-term blue chip stocks. We then examined the analyst upside and the hedge fund sentiment of these stocks as of Q2 2024 and picked the most popular ones. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024 as a primary metric and analyst upside as of October 13, as a secondary metric.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a well-known technology company behind the commonly used Microsoft Suite. The company also develops cloud products and personal computing products. Like its peers, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is pouring capital into artificial intelligence. Over the past few months, the company has closed deals with startups and technology companies to run their workloads on Microsoft Azure, its cloud platform. A few days ago, the company made an addition to its list of partnerships by signing an agreement with Rezolve AI, a startup revolutionizing the online retail landscape. The list does not end here. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with other crucial stakeholders made a $100 billion deal to improve the functioning of data centers and artificial intelligence. In addition to that, the company has also been making strategic investments in AI and data in other countries. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a long-standing company with immensely strong fundamentals. This coupled with its investments in AI and data make it one of the most promising stocks according to hedge funds. Fred Alger Management’s Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.” Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

2024-10-17T19:35:00+00:00,A Sam Altman-backed nuclear power stock soared 150% in a month,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/sam-altman-backed-nuclear-power-193500376.html,"As tech giants turn their attention toward nuclear power for artificial intelligence and data centers, one producer is seeing its shares surge.

Oklo, a nuclear power company that counts OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman as an investor, has seen its shares climb around 150% in the past month. The stock is up almost 50% so far this year. However, during mid-day trading on Thursday, Oklo was down almost 5%.

The Santa Clara, California-based company, which has three project sites, says it’s “developing next-generation fission powerhouses to produce abundant, affordable, clean energy at a global scale.” Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse can produce 15 megawatts of electrical power (MWe), which the company says can scale up to 50 MWe and operate for ten years or longer before needing to be refueled.

Oklo’s shares have been on the up since Microsoft (MSFT) made a 20-year power purchase agreement in September with Constellation Energy (CEG) that will restart the Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island. Constellation, which owns most of the U.S.’s nuclear power plants, has seen its shares rise around 36% in the past month. Its stock is up 138% so far this year.

Through the Microsoft and Constellation deal, which will launch the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC), Microsoft will purchase energy from the Unit 1 reactor as part of its sustainability goal. The CCEC, which is expected to come online by 2028, will add more than 800 MW of carbon-free electricity to the power grid, a study by the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council found.

This week, Google (GOOGL) announced it had signed “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy” from small modular reactors, or SMRs, developed by California-based Kairos Power. The tech giant said it expects to bring Kairos Power’s first SMR online by the end of the decade.

2024-10-17T19:06:18+00:00,State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Cabaletta Bio Inc Holdings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corps-strategic-reduction-190618018.html,"On September 30, 2024, State Street Corp executed a significant transaction by reducing its holdings in Cabaletta Bio Inc (NASDAQ:CABA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The firm sold 1,109,678 shares at a price of $4.72 each, resulting in a remaining stake of 896,123 shares. This move reflects a strategic adjustment in State Street Corp's investment portfolio, despite the trade having a minimal immediate impact on its overall position.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent investment firm known for its robust investment strategies that focus primarily on long-term value creation. With a diverse portfolio of 4,172 stocks, the firm's top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), emphasizing a strong inclination towards the technology and financial services sectors. The firm manages an equity portfolio worth approximately $2,285.63 trillion, showcasing its significant influence in the market.

Cabaletta Bio Inc specializes in engineered T cell therapies aimed at treating B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Utilizing its proprietary Chimeric AutoAntibody Receptor (CAART) technology, the company focuses on selective B cell elimination, which could potentially offer curative treatments. Despite its innovative approach, Cabaletta Bio has faced challenges reflected in its financial metrics, with a market cap of $230.563 million and a GF Score of 39/100, indicating poor future performance potential.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio

The recent reduction in CABA shares by State Street Corp has adjusted the firm's exposure to the biotechnology sector, which now stands at a 1.80% position ratio in their portfolio. This move might be indicative of the firm's strategy to reallocate resources to more promising areas or to mitigate risks associated with the volatile biotech sector.

Since its IPO on October 25, 2019, CABA's stock has declined by 47.56%, with a significant year-to-date drop of 78.7%. These figures highlight the stock's underperformance and the challenging market conditions it faces. The stock's current price aligns with its trade price, suggesting a stable short-term market perception but an uncertain future.

The decision by State Street Corp to reduce its stake in Cabaletta Bio could be driven by the stock's consistent underperformance and the firm's risk management strategy. Looking ahead, the biotechnology sector remains innovative but highly speculative. Cabaletta Bio's future depends on its clinical outcomes and ability to secure regulatory approvals, which are pivotal for its CAART technology's success.

When compared to State Street Corp's other top holdings like Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, Cabaletta Bio represents a smaller, more speculative investment. This sectoral diversification is crucial for balancing potential high-reward investments against stable, high-value assets. State Street Corp's recent portfolio adjustment by reducing its stake in Cabaletta Bio Inc reflects a strategic move to optimize its investment spread. For investors, this transaction highlights the importance of risk assessment and potential realignment in response to market and company-specific challenges. As the market watches Cabaletta Bio's progress, the implications of such investment shifts are critical for understanding broader market dynamics and investment strategies.

2024-10-17T19:05:16+00:00,State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition in Beam Therapeutics Inc,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corps-strategic-acquisition-190516217.html,"On September 30, 2024, State Street Corp made a significant addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 3,929,557 shares of Beam Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:BEAM), a pioneering biotechnology company. This transaction, executed at a price of $24.5 per share, reflects State Street Corp's strategic approach to investing in high-potential sectors. The acquisition not only underscores the firm's commitment to the biotechnology industry but also marks a notable expansion of its holdings in Beam Therapeutics, increasing its stake by 437,402 shares.

Located at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, State Street Corp is a prominent investment firm known for its robust portfolio management strategies. The firm manages a diverse array of assets, with a strong emphasis on technology and financial services sectors. Its top holdings include major corporations such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), highlighting its inclination towards innovation-driven companies. With an equity portfolio valued at approximately $2.285 trillion, State Street Corp continues to influence significant market movements through its investment choices.

Beam Therapeutics Inc, based in the USA, operates within the biotechnology industry and specializes in developing genetic medicines through its proprietary base editing technology. Since its IPO on February 6, 2020, Beam has been at the forefront of genetic medicine, offering innovative solutions across various therapeutic areas. Despite a challenging market, the company maintains a market capitalization of $2.01 billion, with a current stock price of $24.4, slightly below the transaction price.

Beam Therapeutics presents a mixed financial picture. The company's Profitability Rank is notably low at 1/10, and it currently operates at a loss, as indicated by a PE Percentage of 0.00. However, its balance sheet remains relatively strong with a Financial Strength rank of 6/10, supported by a cash to debt ratio of 6.10. Despite these challenges, Beam's revenue growth over the past three years has been impressive, ranking at the top of its industry.

The recent acquisition by State Street Corp significantly bolsters its position in Beam Therapeutics, reflecting a strategic investment in a sector with substantial growth potential. This move is particularly noteworthy given the current market conditions and the firm's portfolio strategy, which heavily favors technological and innovative market segments. The addition of Beam Therapeutics shares could potentially enhance the firm's portfolio diversification, aligning with its long-term investment philosophy.

The biotechnology sector is known for its high volatility and substantial growth potential. Beam Therapeutics' role in this sector is strengthened by its innovative genetic editing technology, which positions it well for future advancements. However, the industry faces significant challenges, including high research and development costs and regulatory hurdles, which Beam must navigate to capitalize on its technological advancements. Looking ahead, Beam Therapeutics' focus on expanding its genetic editing capabilities and advancing its clinical programs may drive future growth. Analysts are cautiously optimistic, given the company's strong research pipeline and recent expansions. However, potential investors should consider the inherent risks associated with the biotechnology sector. In conclusion, State Street Corp's recent acquisition of shares in Beam Therapeutics represents a calculated enhancement to its investment portfolio. This move not only diversifies its holdings but also positions the firm to capitalize on the future successes of Beam's innovative genetic therapies. For value investors, this transaction highlights the importance of considering long-term growth potential and technological advancements in investment decisions.

2024-10-17T19:03:00+00:00,State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Assurant Inc Holdings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corps-strategic-reduction-190300709.html,"On September 30, 2024, State Street Corp executed a significant transaction involving the sale of 70,573 shares in Assurant Inc (NYSE:AIZ), a prominent player in the insurance sector. This move reduced their holdings by 2.89%, bringing the total shares held to 2,372,237. The shares were traded at a price of $198.86 each. Despite this reduction, State Street Corp maintains a substantial position in Assurant, reflecting a 4.60% ownership in the company and a minor 0.02% portfolio position.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a globally recognized investment firm. With a vast portfolio of 4,172 stocks, the firm is a major player in the financial services and technology sectors. Their top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). State Street Corp's investment philosophy focuses on leveraging market trends and technological advancements to maximize returns. The firm's equity holdings amount to a staggering $2,285.63 trillion, underscoring its influential presence in the investment world.

Assurant Inc, with its diverse range of insurance products, operates primarily through its Global Housing and Global Lifestyle segments. The company, which went public on February 5, 2004, has a market capitalization of $10.26 billion and a stock price of $198.09. Assurant is currently rated as ""Fairly Valued"" with a GF Value of $183.95 and a price to GF Value ratio of 1.08. The company's profitability and growth metrics are robust, with a GF Score of 85/100, indicating a strong potential for future performance.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio

The recent sale of Assurant shares by State Street Corp, although minor in terms of their overall portfolio, reflects a strategic adjustment. This reduction might be indicative of risk management or portfolio rebalancing efforts, especially considering the firm's significant exposure to technology and financial services sectors.

Assurant has shown a commendable year-to-date stock price increase of 16.62% and an impressive 734.06% gain since its IPO. The company's financial health is solid, with a cash to debt ratio of 0.82 and an interest coverage of 10.14. These figures reflect Assurant's ability to cover its financial obligations while continuing to grow revenue and earnings, evidenced by a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.80%.

Other significant investors in Assurant include Gotham Asset Management, LLC, and Jefferies Group (Trades, Portfolio). State Street Corp's strategy in managing its Assurant holdings differs from these firms, which may be adopting a more bullish stance given the insurance industry's current dynamics. State Street Corp's investment strategy is heavily influenced by its dominant sectors: technology and financial services. The insurance industry, where Assurant operates, is undergoing significant transformations with technological integration and regulatory changes. State Street Corp's adjustment in its Assurant position might be a strategic move to align with broader market trends and optimize its portfolio performance in light of these industry shifts. This transaction underscores State Street Corp's active management approach, aiming to capitalize on market movements and sectoral shifts to deliver optimal investment returns.

2024-10-17T18:35:58+00:00,"Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and Gaming To Drive Low Double Digit Growth: Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-azure-office-365-gaming-183558281.html,"Bank of America Securities analyst Bradley Sills reiterated a Buy rating on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a price target of $510.

Sills noted that Microsoft is well positioned to generate sustained low double-digit growth in the coming 3-5 years, led by continued adoption of the Azure cloud infrastructure platform, the cloud-based Office 365 productivity suite, and more profitable Games and Game Pass revenue in Xbox.

While a revenue mix shift toward lower-margin Azure and O365 segments is likely to offset scale benefits near-term, the analyst said operating expense scale will likely drive stable 50bps annual margin expansion over the coming years.

Most Sills’ partners suggest solidly inline or better first-quarter fiscal 2025 results. As such, the analyst expects a 0%—1% upside to his first-quarter revenue estimate of $64.7 billion (+14% year-on-year, +11% year-on-year organic), driven by steady workload migration to Azure and upgrade momentum in the Office premium E3 and E5 cycle, somewhat offset by PC and Windows softness.

Sills’ commentary with partners suggests an inline migration of workloads to Azure, led by cloud migration and expanding AI. The analyst noted that security remained an area of strength.

He would look for upside Azure growth of 33%-34% year-on-year, under restated metrics (with 12% points from AI), versus his base of 33% (11%).

Sills’ estimate for M365 copilot revenue remains modest at $275 million. For More Personal Computing, he expects a largely inline result with his $12.5 billion estimate (+12% Y/Y).

The analyst flagged that the stock is +10.4% year-to-date, driven by enthusiasm for AI-led growth in Azure and Office. However, the shares have lagged recently due to concerns about ramping capex and limited visibility on the respective return on investment.

As per Sills, the stock is trading at 32 times the calendar year 2026 free cash flow, which is not stretched given the durability of low to mid-30s Azure growth, low mid-teens Office growth, and long-term scale on capex.

The analyst would look for multiple expansions as he approaches the expected second half of fiscal 2026 Azure reacceleration.

The price target of $510 is based on an EV/FCF multiple of 40 times calendar year 2026 FCF or 1.9 times adjusted for low 20s growth, a premium to the software GARP group at 1.5 times for durability of growth.

2024-10-17T18:04:45+00:00,"AAPL, MSFT, or GOOGL: Which Tech Company is the Better Buy this Earnings Season?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aapl-msft-googl-tech-company-180445275.html,"As earnings season approaches for big technology companies, I will compare Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) using the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to determine which stock is the best buy. While I hold a neutral outlook on Apple and a bullish outlook on both Microsoft and Alphabet, a closer analysis suggests that Microsoft may be the best choice heading into earnings.

I hold a neutral stance on Apple ahead of its earnings report on Oct. 31. My skepticism is due to what I view as overly optimistic revisions from Wall Street analysts, with 21 out of 25 raising earnings per share (EPS) estimates and 21 out of 24 boosting revenue projections over the past three months. The consensus expects EPS of $1.55 (up 6% year-over-year) and revenues of $94.23 billion (up 5.3%).

While the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, both capable of running artificial intelligence (AI), are key to Apple’s growth, initial sales of 37 million units fell 12.7% below the iPhone 15’s launch figures. The full potential of these devices, however, may not be realized until more AI features become available, delaying any AI-driven super cycle.

Apple’s performance in China will also be important this earnings season. Over the last nine months, Apple’s sales in China have dropped by 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in Fiscal Q3 compared to last year, reflecting a downward trend. While there was an expectation of demand recovery in Fiscal Q4 due to the iPhone 16 launch, the full impact is likely to materialize over the coming year when AI-driven updates become available.

Additionally, Apple’s Services segment should continue to post record revenues, benefiting from Apple’s ecosystem of 2.2 billion active iOS devices.

I rate Apple as a Hold ahead of its earnings, though I expect near-term growth to sustain the stock’s momentum, which is trading near all-time highs. Despite this, I see few catalysts that will enable the company to surpass the upwardly revised expectations.

Moreover, Apple’s options chains reflects some volatility, with an expected price swing ahead of earnings of 4.7% in either direction based on an at-the-money $230 strike price for options expiring on Nov. 1. The chart below illustrates the options chain.

At TipRanks, Apple’s Wall Street consensus is a Moderate Buy, with 23 out of 34 analysts recommending investors Buy the stock. The average price target is $248.90, suggesting potential upside of 7.99%.

I am bullish on Microsoft leading into earnings scheduled for Oct. 30. Despite beating expectations across the board with its previous financial results, that print did not positively impact MSFT stock. And, analysts have revised their projections downward for the upcoming Fiscal Q1 2025 earnings.

In the past three months, 15 of 21 analysts have lowered their EPS estimates, and all 26 have revised revenue projections for Fiscal Q1. Current expectations are for EPS of $3.10 (a 3.7% year-over-year increase) and revenues of $64.54 billion (up 14.2%). Last quarter, a major concern that hurt Microsoft was the announcement of increased infrastructure spending to meet growing demand. This spending is expected to pressure margins in the current Fiscal year. Additionally, the performance of the Intelligent Cloud segment, led by Azure, showed some moderation, with Azure growing by 22% year-over-year in the previous quarter. These revised estimates present a more tempered view, giving Microsoft an opportunity to meet or exceed expectations with its upcoming results. I rate Microsoft a Buy ahead of its earnings, believing that with lower expectations and more patient investors, the company’s strong cloud performance and sustained gross margins near 70% should be better appreciated. This could help the stock return to its all-time high of $468 per share reached in July of this year. However, the options chain below indicates significant volatility, with an expected price swing of 5.9% ahead of earnings, based on the at-the-money straddle for options expiring on Nov. 1, at a strike price of $412.50. At TipRanks, Microsoft has a Strong Buy rating from Wall Street, with 26 of 29 analysts rating it a Buy and an average price target of $503.13, suggesting potential upside of 21.84%. I have a positive outlook for Alphabet ahead of its Q3 earnings report on Oct. 29, as Wall Street expectations seem balanced and the company may exceed conservative guidance. Analysts have made 17 upward and 18 downward EPS revisions, along with 16 upward and 13 downward revenue revisions in the past three months. The target to beat is an EPS of $1.84 (up 19% year-over-year) and revenues of $86.23 billion (up 12.4% year-over-year). While Alphabet’s Q2 results beat expectations, YouTube’s ad revenue of $8.66 billion fell short of the $8.93 billion consensus, contributing to the mixed revisions. Management also cautioned that operating margins could be impacted by increased depreciation, higher infrastructure costs, and the pull-forward of hardware launches. Despite concerns about losing market share in Search due to rising AI competition, Google Search showed steady growth in this year’s second quarter, with double-digit growth expected to continue. Any potential weaknesses in YouTube or Search can be offset by Google Cloud, which experienced a 29% revenue increase in Q2, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of growth. I rate Alphabet as a Buy ahead of its earnings, as the stock has fallen nearly 13% since its Q2 report, which I believe to be somewhat of an overreaction. Alphabet appears well-positioned to deliver strong performance for the third quarter, supported by a more balanced market outlook. Compared to Apple and Microsoft, Alphabet’s options chains below shows the lowest volatility ahead of earnings. The expected price swing is 2.8% in either direction, based on the at-the-money straddle for options expiring on Nov. 1, calculated using a $165 strike price. According to TipRanks, Alphabet is rated a Strong Buy, with 39 analysts recommending Buy and nine recommending Hold. The average price target is $200.92, indicating potential upside of 21.48%. While analysts are revising estimates upward for Apple, making it harder to beat expectations in a transitional quarter, softer expectations for Microsoft and Alphabet create a better outlook for earnings beats. Though I consider both MSFT and GOOGL to be Buys, I believe Microsoft is the stronger choice as its stock likely has more room to run and it could easily beat modest earnings expectations.",MSFT,yes,eod,1375
2024-10-17T18:03:30+00:00,Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff blasts rival Microsoft’s ‘disappointing’ Copilot: ‘It just doesn’t work’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-blasts-180330990.html,"Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is no fan of Microsoft’s AI tool, Copilot, and he’s not staying quiet about it.

While Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last year compared the significance of Copilot’s launch to that of historic technologies like the PC and the internet, Benioff said in an X post Thursday that Copilot is not worth the hype (to put it lightly).

“When you look at how Copilot has been delivered to customers, it’s disappointing. It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy,” he wrote.

Benioff also called Copilot “Clippy 2.0” and implied it would be as much of a failure as Microsoft’s retired paper-clip assistant meant to help users craft Word documents and save documents among other things.

“I have yet to find anyone who’s had a transformational experience with Microsoft Copilot or the pursuit of training and retraining custom LLMs,” he wrote.

Copilot was released by Microsoft last year to help users be more productive by assisting in the creation of PowerPoints, Excel documents, and more using artificial intelligence.

Benioff’s comments were the latest attack in what has become a monthslong feud with Microsoft and its AI product. Benioff also compared Copilot to Clippy in an interview with Bloomberg during the company’s annual Dreamforce event. And in August, during the company’s second-quarter earnings call, Benioff said, “Microsoft has disappointed so many customers with AI.”

In his most recent tirade against Microsoft’s AI, Benioff linked to an article covering his comments during a podcast interview in which he expanded on his Copilot criticism. In the interview, Benioff cited a report from research firm Gartner that found that only 6% of the 132 IT leaders it surveyed had completed a pilot project with Copilot and were moving to wide-scale adoption of the product in their organizations, Business Insider reported.

Microsoft did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

In the interview, Benioff also hyped up Salesforce’s new AI product, Agentforce, which it released in September. The suite of AI tools—”what AI was meant to be,” in Benioff’s words—helps companies analyze data and make decisions in service, sales, marketing, and commerce. Agentforce is already being piloted by companies such as OpenTable and the Wyndham hotel chain.

Microsoft’s corporate vice president of AI at work, Jared Spataro, told Yahoo Finance that its number of 10,000-seat subscriptions had doubled, and among its customers were large companies like Disney, Dow, and Novartis. But as for Copilot’s future success, Benioff isn’t holding his breath. “I don’t think Copilot will be around. I don’t think customers will use it, and I think that we will see the transformation of enterprises with agents, and Agentforce will be the No. 1 supplier,” he said.

2024-10-17T17:34:21+00:00,Microsoft Report Exposes Sharp Rise in Global Cyberattacks Amid Geopolitical Tensions,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-report-exposes-sharp-rise-173421789.html,"In its annual Digital Defense Report, Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) has expressed concern about the increase in cyber attacks, with the organization's customers being attacked up to 600 million times per day. The assessment for the period July 2023 to June 2024 shows how cyber activities are increasingly linked to international relations and geopolitics.

The growth of cybercrime gang affiliation with nation-states is emerging as a troubling development within the cybersecurity environment. As the report has it, these actors are not only borrowing strategies but are now more integrated to challenge supply systems and promote geopolitics. For example, Russian actors have been to farm out cyber spying operations against Ukraine, and Iran has relied on ransomware in cyber-influence campaigns against Israel.

North Koreas entry into the ransomware domain ought to be incredibly worrisome. The new ransomware of the regime called FakePenny' was employed in the extortion attacks on aerospace and defense firms after data leaked, implying a high civil cyber war.

Cyber threats that will be targeted in the upcoming election for the white house seat have already been observed from Russia, Iran, and China in their bid to exploit political differences to achieve the primary goal of destabilizing the electoral process and planting doubt in the minds of the people in the legitimacy of the democratic process. As such, critical events that are prone to happen are threatening to attack, and in the eyes of Matt Aldridge of OpenText Cybersecurity, the global supply chain is really vulnerable to such sophisticated cyber attacks.

According to Microsoft and experts in the field of cybersecurity, the situation requires increased cooperation between the public and the private sector and for private companies to adopt new levels of cybersecurity. These include effective threat identification solutions, comprehensive employee awareness of cyber security, advanced protection measures to prevent risks, and fast response to incidents.

2024-10-17T17:12:18+00:00,"Amazon, Google Join Nuclear Power Push, Triggering Market Surge",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-google-join-nuclear-power-171218606.html,"The Uranium stocks have popped as significant tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN, Financial), Microsoft (MSFT, Financial), and Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial) deepen their nuclear power bets. It started with Microsoft's power purchase agreement made last month that will revamp the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station for AI's burgeoning growth.

This week, we saw the spectrum shifting a gear higher as a giant such as Amazon revealed partnerships with Energy Northwest, Dominion Energy, and X-energy to pursue Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which have thus brightened up investor confidence in the sector. On the same day, Google's parent company Alphabet was revealed to be investing $10 million in Kairos Power to develop the initial 500MW of advanced small modular reactor facilities, all in a sign of a sector switching to more compact and environmentally friendly power generation technology.

The market confronting them responded sharply and violently. New interesting information about uranium mining and nuclear energy Company Cameco (CCJ, Financial) rocketed 8.2%, Denison Mines (DNN, Financial) and Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE, Financial) went 14.7 % per share higher and 17% higher, respectively. NuScale Power (SMR, Financial, which was revealed earlier had a large stake in the SMR market, rocketed up by a magnificent 31.6% and reached its highest point ever.

The enthusiasm for nuclear power is underpinned by the IAEA's latest forecasts on nuclear capability, which indicate a probability of a 2.5-fold increase in capacity by 2050. This projection is in line with the rising global push to escalate nuclear deployment as part of the plan to realize net-zero carbon emissions.

Closely following this, tech giants set the pace, investing in nuclear power. They did not merely ignite the upturn of relevant stocks, but they also indicated nuclear energy as a crucial factor that could shape the future energy scenario, generating a cleaner and more sustainable energy mix.

2024-10-17T15:33:00+00:00,Amazon Earnings Preview: The Weakest of the Magnificent 7?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-earnings-preview-weakest-magnificent-153300550.html,"Of all the Magnificent 7 stocks, Amazon (AMZN) has been the most challenging for investors to own over the last several years. While all the other companies in the group excluding Tesla are trading significantly higher than their 2021 highs, Amazon languishes. Amazon’s stock price is at the same price as it was in July 2021. May this lack of progress in the stock price be an opportunity for discerning investors?

Amazon's stock has moved sideways over the past three years, allowing its valuation to become increasingly attractive as the company’s earnings have continued to grow. This period of stagnation in share price, combined with steady profit and sales growth, appears to have positioned the stock at a more appealing level for investors.

Today, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions. However, with its historically cheap valuation and strong growth forecasts, it may be an attractive addition to investors’ portfolios. Amazon reports earnings Thursday, October 24. This analysis will examine the upcoming earnings expectations for Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing segments, as well as the potential impact of artificial intelligence on the business, to assess whether the stock presents a worthwhile investment opportunity. We will also compare Amazon to two other Magnificent 7 members – Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).

Despite the less than encouraging stock price action, Amazon has continuously posted strong earnings over the past year. During the last four quarterly earnings meetings, Amazon has beaten analysts’ expectations every time with an average beat of 31.13%. Although the Zacks earnings ESP is not projecting an earnings beat this quarter, earnings are projected to grow nicely nonetheless, and sales are expected to progress nicely as well.

Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, continues to dominate the highly competitive cloud services market, and last quarter reported a $100 billion annual revenue run rate. Most notably, web services revenue growth has been reaccelerating and shows continued expansion in margins. Artificial intelligence is and will continue to be a major catalyst for AWS, as its intense demand for computing power should power more growth in the years ahead.

Regarding the retail business, analysts are expecting close to double digit year over year growth although there are still some concerns. Expanding internationally offers growth opportunities for Amazon but also brings challenges, including the negative impact of currency fluctuations on e-commerce results, especially with the strong dollar putting pressure on profitability. Additionally, competition is intensifying as traditional retailers like Walmart and Target enhance their e-commerce capabilities, while regional rivals such as MercadoLibre, Flipkart, and Alibaba pose significant threats in key international markets.

Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all major players in the cloud computing space, with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, respectively. While AWS leads the market share, both Azure and Google Cloud have been rapidly expanding their capabilities, with Alphabet leveraging its AI expertise and Microsoft integrating cloud services with its software ecosystem. In terms of valuation, Alphabet appears attractively priced at 21.6x forward earnings, which is below its five-year median of 23.8x. Microsoft, on the other hand, trades at a higher valuation of 32x forward earnings, above its five-year median of 22.3x. Meanwhile, Amazon is trading at 38.5x forward earnings, significantly lower than its five-year median of 70.1x, suggesting potential value as the stock has lagged despite continued growth in earnings and cloud revenues. Amazon's stock has been challenging for investors over the past several years, especially compared to other ""Magnificent 7"" stocks. While companies like Alphabet and Microsoft have climbed well beyond their 2021 highs, Amazon's stock price is still languishing around the same level as it was in mid-2021. This lack of progress could be an opportunity for patient investors who see potential in the company's evolving business and improving valuation. Despite stagnant stock performance, Amazon's valuation has become more attractive as earnings and revenues have continued to grow. AMZN has also spawned multibillion dollar new businesses like Advertising, Alexa and Prime video which continue to grow nicely and give another reason to never count this technology juggernaut out of the race. As Amazon heads into its earnings report on October 24, key segments to watch include e-commerce, where nearly double-digit growth is expected, and Amazon Web Services, which continues to lead the cloud computing market. And while of course risks remain, Amazon's steady business growth, attractive valuation, and leading cloud position make it worth considering for investors willing to look beyond short-term challenges.

The analysts cite growing confidence in Zoom's enterprise business, stabilizing churn, and new opportunities in the contact center segment as key reasons for the optimistic outlook.

""We are upgrading our rating...as the company expects to see a re-acceleration in growth across enterprise customers while seeing its churn stabilize,"" Wedbush wrote.

Wedbush notes that Zoom's core products are now unified via its communications platform, Zoom One, which integrates meetings, phone, chat, and more.

Wedbush believes the company's broad product portfolio enables ""strong upsell and cross-sell opportunities,"" with customers increasingly subscribing to multiple products.

Notably, Wedbush says 13% of enterprise customers now use three or more Zoom products, contributing 66% of the company's total annual recurring revenue (ARR).

The firm highlights promising growth in Zoom's expansion into the contact center segment. While the contact center product (CCaaS) is on a slower growth path compared to the earlier success of Zoom Phone, Wedbush believes it will still hit a $400 million run rate within four years.

Zoom Phone ""took ~4.5 years from launch to reach ~10% of revenues, but this might take slightly longer with ZM representing a much larger revenue base while expecting solid upside as it tracks closely with Zoom Phone, making it likely to reach ~$400 million run rate in ~4 years after launch"" noted Wedbush.

Wedbush also said Zoom's churn rate has improved to 2.9% after stricter payment enforcement. The stability is expected to drive enterprise revenue growth throughout the second half of 2025 and accelerate into fiscal 2026.

""Churn decreased...bringing more stability to its net retention rate,"" the firm states.

Despite growing competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Workspace, and other UCaaS providers, Wedbush sees Zoom well-positioned to address a $235 billion addressable market by 2028.

2024-10-17T13:54:03+00:00,First US auction of nature-based carbon credits scheduled for early 2025,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-us-auction-of-nature-based-carbon-credits-scheduled-for-early-2025-135403332.html,"The American Forest Foundation (AFF) recently announced that the nonprofit will hold the US's first nature-based carbon credit auction early next year.

In February 2025, buyers will be able to bid on premium carbon credits from four projects under the Family Forest Carbon Program, an initiative that connects landowners with technical and financial resources to more sustainably manage private forest lands.

""We are trying to address several pain points that exist in the current voluntary market for buyers of carbon credits, but also for landowners who are seeking to participate in the market,"" Nate Truitt, executive vice president of climate funding at the American Forest Foundation, told Yahoo Finance. ""And we're also seeking to close what is a really substantial financing gap for natural climate solutions, a gap that we're going to have to close globally if we're going to stay on a 1.5- or even a two-degree scenario.""

Price volatility, market inefficiency, and a credibility crisis in the voluntary carbon market — along with the AI boom and other factors — have contributed to the recent trend of companies pulling back from their net-zero pledges. Corporations such as Shell (SHEL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Crocs (CROX) have missed, delayed, or weakened their sustainability targets in recent years.

Truitt expects interest in the auction from companies in sectors such as consumer goods that produce high emissions or are relatively less active in carbon markets but have decarbonization strategies in place. He also anticipates some interest from universities.

Among companies purchasing carbon credits, Microsoft dominates after setting an ambitious goal in 2020 to become carbon-negative within a decade. Other Big Tech firms such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are consistent buyers. However, Truitt doesn't expect Big Tech companies to ultimately participate in this auction as they already employ large procurement teams.

Truitt instead sees the auction as attracting ""the next wave of carbon credit buyers,"" comprised of actors that currently must navigate confusing spot markets, sift through individual carbon credit offerings, or sign on to long-term purchase agreements in a largely unregulated market.

“It's our hope that by lowering these transaction costs and the friction of this, ... we can get some of those buyers to come to the table,” Truitt said.

AFF is auctioning carbon credits for two types of projects. The first aims to improve forest management and carbon sequestration on 90,000 acres of land from Maine to Alabama held by 700 family landowners enrolled in the project. The second and newer type of project pays cattle ranchers and pasture owners in Georgia to plant trees on 1,500 acres of land.

Another feature of AFF's auction will be an advance funding mechanism. In addition to bidding on the number and price of carbon credits to be delivered at a later date, companies will determine a percentage they are willing to pay for up-front in exchange for a discount. Buyers have spent roughly $3 billion on durable carbon removal credits since October 2019, according to reporting platform CDR.fyi; however, the market could grow more rapidly with better access to low-cost financing. Truitt underscored that many projects are ready to get off the ground. But because these projects involve more risk — natural disasters and changing rules around offsets add to uncertainty — they often have a difficult time securing lending. If successful, AFF hopes its auction design can be used by other carbon market participants and remove barriers to these transactions. ""We're not solving climate change, but we're trying to develop a tool that will enable the voluntary carbon market to scale quicker and to produce higher-quality carbon credits that can be trusted by buyers, investors, and the general public,"" Truitt said.

(Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images) Tim Stout is one landowner participating in the project. Stout and his family own a 175-acre former dairy farm in Vermont that was passed down from his great-grandfather. He and his brother have managed the heavily forested property for the past 40 years, and after evaluating different carbon projects, their family enrolled in the Family Forest Carbon Program. The financial benefits are ""fairly modest,"" Stout said. ""I mean, over 20 years, it's a healthy amount,"" he clarified, ""but I think for ... the program to really take off, the price of carbon credits has to go way up."" AFF said it uses Verra's verified carbon standard and its own internal methodology developed with the Nature Conservancy to vet the quality of the credits. ""A messy forest is better than a clean forest because … all the downed trees, all the branches, all the leaf litter is storing carbon,"" Stout explained about how these plans have changed the way he and his family manage their land. ""We're moving more and more to kind of a messy forest."" At the same time, the cost of managing land has ""gone up significantly,"" Stout said. Extreme weather attributed to climate change has exacerbated costs. Heavy rainfall and flooding in Vermont, which experienced a 1-in-1,000-year rain event this summer, eroded the foundation of Stout's barn, incurring a large expense, he said. And strong winds toppled 200-year-old maple trees onto roadways, which needed to be removed.

(Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) Funding from the auction will go toward expenses related to managing the forest and creating long-term land use plans that are developed by landowners, state foresters, and consulting AFF foresters. These plans and smart forestry techniques help forest owners like Stout increase the amount of carbon their forests can sequester. Stout, who now sits on AFF's board, said he was motivated to sign a contract with the Family Forest Carbon Program by his concerns over climate change. He also feels a strong calling to preserve the woodland for future generations and educate other small landowners about sustainable forestry. ""I would love to have my 4-year-old grandson and 2-year-old granddaughter be able to visit that [land] when they're my age and have a healthy, robust, resilient forest that's still playing a role in mitigating climate change,"" he said.

2024-10-17T12:48:11+00:00,Morgan Stanley hikes price targets on networking equipment stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-hikes-price-targets-124811110.html,"Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley raised its price targets for two key networking equipment stocks on Thursday, although the firm cautioned that the sector’s recovery remains slow.

The bank’s price target for Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), one of the industry leaders, was maintained at $58, as analysts view the company as well-positioned to benefit from the resolution of inventory digestion issues and initial synergies from its Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) acquisition.

Moreover, Cisco is expected to capitalize on the disruption caused by the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) and Juniper Networks Inc (NYSE:JNPR) dislocation.

These catalysts, Morgan Stanley notes, “could help cloud the valuation gap to the S&P 500.”

Meanwhile, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) saw its price target lifted from $355 to $410, driven by the company’s strong performance in cloud and enterprise sectors, particularly benefitting from the ongoing weakness of Juniper and HPE.

Arista’s positive data points during the quarter include making inroads with major cloud customers and gaining share from competitors.

“Overall, Arista's CQ3 VAR performance was the strongest of the networking vendors, with resellers seeing between +2-15% Y/Y growth in CQ3,” analysts said.

They believe that capital expenditure (capex) figures from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) will be a key catalyst for Arista Networks' stock ahead of earnings. The next major driver for the stock may be the deployment of Meta's 100,000 cluster, though there is still uncertainty regarding the timing of these deployments.

F5 Networks Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) also received a price target boost, from $200 to $215, reflecting better confidence in its multi-cloud project opportunities, though growth remains more gradual.

However, “while there has been some pickup in multi-cloud projects, our checks indicate this has not meaningfully translated to results for F5,” the report explained.

In terms of valuation, analysts said their $215 is based on a 15 times price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for 2025, representing a discount compared to mature large-cap software companies. However, it reflects increased confidence that current demand levels have reached their lowest point.

In broader terms, analysts said the overall demand environment for networking equipment remains tepid, with their checks indicating ""no meaningful pickup in overall networking demand"" in recent quarters.

Service provider spending continues to be a weak spot, contributing to slower-than-expected recovery, though the firm sees pockets of incremental spend in data centers and campus networks.",MSFT,yes,eod,535

• The chart of the day

If the summer was about the ROI on AI, or really, the absence of it, how much patience does Wall Street have for tech’s fall earnings?

Judging by the surge in chip stocks, investors waiting for details about where all that infrastructure money is going and when new revenue will be coming will have to wait a while longer. An appreciating asset is its own defense.

As analysts press tech executives for clearer timelines around the supposed AI transformation, chip names continue to climb. Nvidia is once again threatening Apple as the market’s most valuable company. Semiconductor names are amassing gains, reversing a downfall from August. And on Wednesday, the rally fired up again after chip industry bellwether TSMC's (TSM) strong AI-fueled sales forecast.

That reflects the intense demand for AI processing and infrastructure and a disregard for short-term worries over ballooning capex. Chasing the dream is expensive.

And once again investors are wondering where the limit is — if it exists.

Third quarter reports are primed to test those boundaries with even more money at stake. The longer the capex hose stays open and the more vehemently executives fuse their identities with the AI wave, the harder it will be to turn back. Megacap tech companies are expected to dedicate $215 billion to AI capital expenditures this year, and according to Goldman Sachs, another $250 billion in 2025.

A slowdown in investment isn’t here yet. But we’ll be looking for clues on how long AI growth will last until company whims, preferences, and future spending start to reveal themselves on spreadsheets. It’s only a matter of time before the imagined productivity gains and “innovative AI use cases” come due.

The tight, symbiotic ecosystem of selling AI hardware suggests that as soon as Big Tech eases spending or pivots elsewhere, previously robust fundamentals might be destabilized.

The tech giants largely disappointed Wall Street last quarter. Only Meta came out with a clear victory. While reactions to earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) highlighted how heavy AI investment can become a liability, Zuckerberg showed that Wall Street doesn’t mind swelling capex, as long as every other part of the business is exceeding expectations. That’s a high bar to clear. And it will only get harder as the spending side of the ledger gets bigger without surefire revenue to offset it.

Seeing past risk is a virtue at the top of the corporate ladder. So is suppressing bubble chatter. If the upward trajectory of chip stocks is a bellwether then the tech giants will continue to double down on their mega disbursements. That’s what we would expect from tenacious leadership. Even if everyone else is anxious for answers. Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on X @hshaban.

2024-10-17T09:36:00+00:00,"Meet The Low-Cost Vanguard ETF That Has 20% Of Its Holdings in Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-low-cost-vanguard-etf-093600568.html,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is surging once again, passing Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to become the second most valuable U.S.-based company behind Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Nvidia's new Blackwell graphics processing unit architecture could deliver significant performance improvements and cost efficiency, which would be a win for Nvidia and its customers.

Folks looking to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) could simply buy Nvidia stock as a catch-all way to play a rise in computing power demand. But there are also exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to consider.

With a more than 20% stake in Nvidia, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT) stands out as an excellent way to invest in the semiconductor industry without racking up high fees.

The technology sector is, by far, the largest sector in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) -- making up 31.7% of the index. One look at its top holdings and it is easy to see why.

Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom have a combined market cap of over $10.5 trillion -- making the sector very top-heavy.

And while the tech sector used to be dominated by software and hardware companies, semiconductors are now the largest industry within the sector, making up 28.9% of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.

So, while investors could turn to pure-play semiconductor funds like the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may be a better long-term investment. For starters, the iShares Semiconductor ETF has a 0.35% expense ratio compared to just 0.1% for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.

The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, making an ETF that focuses only on chip stocks volatile.

With the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, an investor gains access to the infrastructure and processing might that is powering AI, as well as AI-driven tools like those deployed by software companies Microsoft, Adobe, or Apple phones with AI chips.

Factors to consider before buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF

The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a great way to invest in today's top tech companies. However, its greatest drawbacks are that it offers little exposure to smaller companies (given the size of the largest tech companies), and it leaves out some important names that you may think are in the tech sector.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Google's parent company, Alphabet, are in the communications sector. So you won't find these four names in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. Amazon Web Services is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure -- which is critical for running global AI models. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has arguably been the single best example of a company investing heavily in AI (and buying a lot of Nvidia chips) and showing why those investments are paying off. Vanguard offers a low-cost mega-cap growth fund that targets top growth stocks regardless of their sector. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) may be a better fit for investors who want less exposure to tech stocks and better coverage of the largest growth stocks by market cap. Let ETFs work for you Nvidia has captured the spotlight as the leader in AI innovation in the semiconductor space. Still, some investors may prefer AMD as an underdog that could take market share from Nvidia over time. Meanwhile, Broadcom offers a nice blend of value, growth, and income, given its diversified business and growing dividend. The fact that the tech sector has a 20% weighting in these three stocks alone shows how valuable these companies have become. Buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a simple way to add to your exposure to these three names and the rest of the semiconductor industry. It's also an excellent way to avoid the risks of betting on a single company to invest in AI or another trend. The best way to approach individual stocks and ETFs is to use them to suit your interests, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. Investors who closely follow the sector may prefer to build their tech portfolio around chip stocks and leave out the big software names. But folks looking for a low-cost passive approach may prefer the hands-off nature of simply buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and resting easy knowing it is chock-full of semiconductor stocks -- so they won't miss out if the industry continues to soar higher. Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this. On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:
• Amazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,139!*
• Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $44,239!*
• Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $380,729!* Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.

Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market.

A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells.

The economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September.

“It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.”

“But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels.

A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election.

While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around.

“Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows. AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth. Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value. To make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Microsoft Edge is one of the most promising future stocks, according to analysts, as it is the biggest software provider. Additionally, the company is a leading player with a 25% market share in cloud computing while flexing its muscle in the multi-billion gaming industry with Activation’s Blizzard and Xbox. With the aid of new generative artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well-positioned to increase its market share in those software categories. During the June quarter, the number of users of Microsoft 365 Copilot grew by more than 60%. Regarding revenue from cloud infrastructure and platform services, Microsoft Azure lags behind Amazon Web Services; however, over the past year, Azure has gained a percentage point of market share thanks to its strengths in machine learning and artificial intelligence and according to CEO Satyr Nacelle, Azure AI’s customer base increased by almost 60% during that time. The vast majority of Microsoft’s planned capital expenditure increases will go toward expanding its AI infrastructure and cloud business. In its fiscal year 2024, it spent $55.7 billion, of which $19 billion was spent in the fourth quarter. Because of its strengths in cloud computing and enterprise software, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the businesses most positioned to profit from generative AI in the future. In fact, Wall Street predicts that over the next three years, the company’s earnings will increase by 13% per year. Even though Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31, It is one of the most promising stocks given its record in returning shareholder value. The company already pays a 0.80% dividend yield. Additionally, the stock is rated as a strong buy based on 30 Wall Street analysts with an average price target of $504.73, implying a 21.71% change from the last price of $414.71. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.068 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 7th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-10-17T00:00:00+00:00,Here's My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock for Dividend Investors,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/17/heres-my-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-for/,"This stock can grant investors two benefits (growth and dividends) for the price of one.

The artificial intelligence (AI) market is taking off, providing a significant tailwind for several growth-oriented companies. However, that doesn't mean income-seeking investors can't get in on the act. Several AI leaders, including Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, pay dividends. Which stock provides the best combination of AI-related growth and an attractive dividend program? In my view, the answer to that question is Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%). Read on to find out why.

Of the top tech companies benefiting from the rapid rise in AI, several don't pay dividends or have been doing so for less than three years. Amazon is in the former category, while Alphabet and Meta Platforms are in the latter.

That does not apply to Nvidia, but the chipmaker's dividend program isn't impressive. Its forward yield is 0.03%. In fairness, that's partly because the company's shares have been on fire lately, but investors can look at other things, including the fact that it isn't in the habit of raising its dividends every year. It recently hiked it significantly, so the total growth of its dividend per share over the past decade amounts to 370.6%.

However, Nvidia's quarterly dividend per share is a minuscule $0.01. How does Microsoft compare? It offers a much more attractive forward yield of 0.8%, raises its dividends regularly, and has increased its payouts by 167.7% in the past decade.

Microsoft's quarterly dividend per share of $0.83 is also far higher than those of its similarly sized tech peers, including Nvidia. Lastly, Microsoft's cash payout ratio is just under 30%, meaning the company has ample room to continue increasing its dividends. But can Microsoft's business support the payouts for a long time?

Microsoft played a role in the ongoing AI gold rush that started with ChatGPT. The tech giant invested in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, back in 2019. Following the chatbot's success, Microsoft doubled down and deepened its relationship with OpenAI. But that's only part of the company's involvement in this niche, and perhaps not the more important part. Microsoft offers a suite of AI-related services through Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing division.

With most companies now seeking at least some of these services, business is booming. In its latest period, the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2024 (ended June 30), Microsoft noted that Azure continues to be one of its fastest-growing segments. Microsoft's total revenue increased by 15% year over year to $64.7 billion. Azure's revenue was up 29% compared to the year-ago period. But how much did AI contribute to that performance? According to management, quite a bit.

Speaking of the cloud market and Azure in particular, CEO Satya Nadella said during the company's earnings conference call, ""Our share gains accelerated this year driven by AI."" This business should continue to provide a major tailwind for Microsoft since AI and cloud computing are both on a growth path. Although these likely represent the tech giant's biggest growth opportunities, there is more to its business. Microsoft remains the runaway leader in the computer operating systems market. It is also a leading player in gaming.

The company benefits from a solid moat from multiple sources. Consider the switching costs associated with its suite of productivity tools (Excel, Word, Teams, etc.). Businesses that rely on these products won't easily jump ship for fear of disrupting their day-to-day activities. Microsoft also carries one of the most valuable brand names in the world, another potent competitive edge.

Microsoft is an innovative company that generates plenty of cash flow and boasts a robust balance sheet, as its AAA rating from Standard & Poor's -- a higher rating than the U.S. government -- confirms.

With Microsoft, investors can get both income and growth, AI-related or otherwise.",MSFT,yes,eod,807
2024-10-17T00:00:00+00:00,Every Microsoft Stock Investor Should Watch This Key Number On Oct. 30,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/17/every-microsoft-stock-investor-key-number-oct-30/,"Investors are about to get a fresh look at Microsoft's artificial intelligence progress.

Corporate America is heading into another important earnings season. Wall Street will be especially focused on results from the technology giants that dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) race because they tend to deliver much stronger revenue and earnings growth than the rest of the stock market.

Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) is scheduled to release the results for its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended Sept. 30) on Oct. 30, and investors will be keenly focused on how well it is monetizing its growing portfolio of AI products and services.

However, there will be one AI number in Microsoft's report that could be more important than the rest.

Microsoft's numerous AI projects will be under the microscope

Early last year, Microsoft rocked the tech sector by announcing plans to invest another $10 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It has since used OpenAI's industry-leading models to create several AI products, including its Copilot virtual assistants, which are capable of generating text, images, and even computer code in response to simple prompts.

Copilot is now embedded for free in most of Microsoft's flagship software, including the Windows operating system, the Edge internet browser, and the Bing search engine. However, the company charges an additional monthly subscription to add Copilot to its Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which includes Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

Companies worldwide pay for more than 400 million 365 seats, and all of them are potential candidates for Copilot add-ons, which presents a significant financial opportunity for Microsoft. During its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (which ended June 30), Microsoft said the number of corporate customers that bought more than 10,000 Copilot add-ons for 365 had doubled from just three months earlier. Investors should look for updates on Copilot numbers in the upcoming quarter.

But the Azure cloud computing platform will likely headline the report, thanks mainly to Azure AI. That's the offering that allows businesses and developers to rent data center computing capacity powered by the latest chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, in order to build their own AI models. Azure AI also offers access to the latest large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4o from OpenAI, which developers can use to accelerate the creation of AI software applications like chatbots and virtual assistants. At the end of Q4, Azure AI had 60,000 customers which was an impressive 60% increase from a year earlier.

The big number that Microsoft investors need to watch

The Azure cloud platform has consistently been the fastest-growing part of Microsoft's entire organization, which is why investors tend to focus on it the most. During Q4, Azure revenue increased 29% year over year, which marked an acceleration from 26% in the prior-year quarter.

Azure's growth is increasingly driven by Azure AI. For example, Azure AI was responsible for 8 percentage points of Azure's overall 29% growth during Q4, which was a record high. That represented a whopping eightfold increase from the year-ago quarter, when Azure AI contributed just 1 percentage point to the company's top-line growth rate.

Microsoft spent a whopping $55.7 billion on capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024, most of which went toward AI data center infrastructure and chips. Management has already said it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025.

The revenue generated by Azure AI is one way to measure the payoffs Microsoft (and its investors) are receiving for those significant financial outlays. Suppose Azure AI continues to contribute an increasing share of growth to Azure. That will indicate that businesses and developers are spending money on computing capacity and access to the latest LLMs.

Based on Microsoft's trailing 12-month earnings per share of $11.80, its stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35.5. That's a 10.5% premium to the 32.1 ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, which includes all of Microsoft's big-tech peers.

The sheer amount of money Microsoft is spending on AI infrastructure will be a headwind for its earnings for at least the next year. Therefore, if Azure AI continues to make a growing contribution to the Azure cloud platform's results, investors will likely be more comfortable with continuing to support the stock's premium valuation. However, if Azure AI stalls or underwhelms, that could trigger a correction in Microsoft stock.

That's why, in my opinion, Azure AI's contribution to Azure's overall revenue growth is the number investors should be watching on Oct. 30.",MSFT,yes,eod,942
2024-10-17T00:00:00+00:00,"Microsoft Is Spending Big on Artificial Intelligence, but Will It Pay Off?",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/17/microsoft-is-spending-big-on-artificial-intelligen/,"Microsoft's capital expenditures have grown by nearly 300% in the past five years.

A big growth opportunity in tech these days is undoubtedly in artificial intelligence (AI). The entire AI market could be worth more than $1.8 trillion by the end of the decade, according to estimates from Grand View Research. That translates into a compound annual growth rate of 36.6%. For tech companies, that mouthwatering level of growth is what helps justify spending heavily on new technologies.

But there's also going to be no shortage of competition in the space. And the announcement that ChatGPT maker OpenAI will incur around $5 billion in losses this year despite generating $3.7 billion in revenue underscores how challenging it may be to turn a profit on AI, especially in the short term.

One company that's investing heavily into AI these days is Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%). Not only has it invested in OpenAI, but it's also spending money on enhancing its products and services with AI capabilities. How big of a payoff that will have on its bottom line, however, is certainly debatable.

Microsoft's capex spending has been through the roof in recent years

Capital expenditures (capex) are what a company spends to add, upgrade, or maintain its assets, for the purpose of growing the business in the long run. It's a discretionary expense and when there's a big growth opportunity, spending can ramp up significantly. In the past five years, Microsoft's capital spending has increased at a far quicker rate than revenue.

This isn't necessarily a cause for concern simply because the goal of increased capital expenditures is greater revenue growth down the road.

The big test will be if this high level of spend leads to an acceleration of Microsoft's growth.

Spending on AI for the sake of investing in AI won't necessarily pay off

Microsoft has the resources necessary to invest in AI, but throwing a lot of money at something doesn't mean that it's going to pay off for the business in the future. There are a growing number of AI-powered products and services in the market these days, and Microsoft will need to prove that it has superior products for that to lead to strong revenue growth.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff compares Microsoft's new Copilot AI to the much maligned Clippy of years past. Microsoft recently rolled out an updated version of Copilot, but if it doesn't impress business users and help justify its $30/month per user price tag for Microsoft 365, the investments the company is making in AI may not end up being worthwhile.

Should you invest in Microsoft's stock?

Shares of Microsoft are up a fairly modest 12% this year (the S&P 500 has risen by 23%) as investors may be growing apprehensive about the stock's valuation and whether AI will be the catalyst the company expects. At 36 times earnings, the tech stock is a bit pricey and its $3.1 trillion valuation means it's one of the most valuable companies in the world.

If you're investing for the long run and willing to hold on for years, then Microsoft can still make for a solid buy. Its dominance of office software products, popular Windows operating system, and expansion into gaming are all reasons why the company can continue to do well for the foreseeable future. The one wrinkle, however, is that without a high growth rate, investors may be hesitant to pay a big premium for the stock. And lackluster growth from AI could exacerbate those concerns.

I expect the company will eventually figure out what works and what doesn't with respect to AI. Microsoft can afford to make mistakes and experiment along the way. And that's why in the short run, if it underwhelms the market with its Copilot AI, it might struggle, but over the long haul the stock is still likely to rise in value.",MSFT,yes,eod,781
2024-10-16T19:45:25+00:00,Nvidia is set to dominate another Big Tech earnings season,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-is-set-to-dominate-another-big-tech-earnings-season-194525244.html,"We’re rolling into what is expected to be another wild tech earnings season, and you can bet AI is going to be front and center. And if there’s one company that everyone is watching, it’s Nvidia (NVDA).

Shares of the chip giant are up more than 16% in the last month, and the stock is currently on pace to unseat Apple as the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization.

The jump comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the company’s upcoming Blackwell chip is “insane” during an interview with CNBC on Oct. 3. Since then, shares of Nvidia have climbed roughly 18%, topping out at $130. But reports that the Biden administration will establish a cap on the number of AI chips that can be shipped to certain countries put the rally on hold Tuesday before recovering some ground Wednesday.

Nvidia’s incredible stock performance and meteoric rise in data center sales over the last year have put the company in a difficult position for its upcoming earnings announcement, which it has yet to officially schedule.

In the company’s fiscal Q3 2024, overall revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion, while data center revenue rose a whopping 279% to $14.5 billion. And while Nvidia isn’t staring down a decline in revenue, its growth will likely slow versus the same period last year, which could spook investors.

Don’t believe me? Just take a look at what happened after the company announced its Q2 earnings back in August. While the company beat on revenue and earnings per share, with data center revenue increasing 154% year over year to $26.3 billion, Nvidia shares still fell more than 6% immediately following the announcement. It took more than a month for the company’s stock price to recover.

The AI trade hasn’t raised all ships, either. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 59% year to date, outpacing the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which rose 21%. Qualcomm (QCOM) climbed 19% and AMD (AMD) added just 6% to its stock price. Intel (INTC), meanwhile, fell a stunning 55%.

Broadcom benefits from its involvement in AI infrastructure, connecting servers and the like, while Qualcomm is seen as a potential beneficiary of on-device AI growth via AI smartphones and AI PCs. AMD is facing off against Nvidia and serves as an alternative on both price and availability.

Then there’s Intel, which is struggling amid its enormous turnaround effort that includes building out its third-party chip fabrication capabilities as well as trying to catch Nvidia and AMD in the AI processor space.

But Nvidia is still the hands-down star of the show this earnings season. Investors will be looking for signs of continued AI spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which make up a huge portion of AI sales, to get a sense of how well Nvidia chips are selling.",MSFT,yes,eod,614

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.

On Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique ""Poltergeist 2 magic.""

Cramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.

He noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.

Cramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:

Cramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.

For this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Cramer mentioned that he does not see a prominent weakness with Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Copilot but cited chatter around it. “Microsoft's supposed to be hurt by weakening demand for its Copilot, with its Copilot being their AI assistant. I have no idea if there's a real weakness here but there is chatter and that's enough to send the stock down. That said, I think the bears need a lot more than chatter to keep it down.” Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has evolved beyond its origins in software, operating systems, and web browsers to become a significant player in various emerging industries. Today, it ranks as one of the largest providers of cloud infrastructure globally, which positions the company favorably to market AI products and services to its cloud clients. In its last quarter, the company reported revenue of $64.7 billion, a 15% increase compared to the previous year. It highlighted impressive growth in its Azure Cloud services. In the quarter, Azure revenue surged by 30%. Looking forward, management expects that the results from Azure will further accelerate in the latter half of fiscal 2025, driven by substantial investments in new data center capacity that are set to come online. Its growth is not solely limited to cloud services, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also experiencing significant adoption of its Copilot software, an AI-powered assistant designed to improve workplace productivity. In the fourth quarter, the number of Microsoft 365 Copilot customers increased by over 60% sequentially. With a user base exceeding 400 million for Office 365, the company remains well-positioned for continued growth in this domain. Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-10-16T19:03:37+00:00,State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Shares in Ocugen Inc,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corps-strategic-acquisition-190337433.html,"On September 30, 2024, State Street Corp made a significant addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 1,047,896 shares of Ocugen Inc (NASDAQ:OCGN), a biotechnology firm based in the USA. This transaction increased State Street Corp's total holdings in Ocugen to 15,824,517 shares, marking a notable expansion in their investment in the biotech sector. The shares were purchased at a price of $0.9922 each, reflecting the firm's strategic approach to investing in potential growth areas.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent investment firm with a diverse portfolio that includes top holdings in major companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). With a strong emphasis on technology and financial services, the firm manages an equity portfolio worth approximately $2,285.63 trillion. State Street Corp's investment philosophy focuses on leveraging market trends and technological advancements to maximize returns.

Ocugen Inc's stock currently trades at $0.9359, experiencing a year-to-date increase of 42.32%. However, since its IPO in 2014, the stock has seen a significant decline of 99.86%. The company's market capitalization stands at approximately $269.404 million, indicating a challenging period in its stock history but also highlighting potential for recovery and growth.

Financial Health and Market Position of Ocugen Inc

Ocugen Inc operates within the competitive biotechnology industry, focusing on innovative therapies for retinal diseases. Despite its pioneering technology, the company's financial metrics such as ROE and ROA are deeply negative, at -117.50% and -79.33% respectively. However, its cash to debt ratio of 2.29 suggests a relatively stable financial position in terms of liquidity.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio

The recent acquisition of Ocugen shares represents a 5.50% position in the company for State Street Corp. This strategic move could be seen as an attempt to diversify into high-potential biotechnology sectors, potentially offsetting risks and enhancing the growth prospects of State Street Corp's extensive portfolio.

Ocugen is committed to addressing unmet medical needs through its innovative gene and cell therapy platforms. The company's focus on diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration positions it well for future growth, pending successful clinical development and potential regulatory approvals.

The biotechnology sector remains a high-risk, high-reward market segment, with investor sentiment generally cautious due to the inherent uncertainties in clinical success rates. Ocugen's stock performance and investor reactions will likely continue to be influenced by clinical trial outcomes and partnership developments. State Street Corp's recent investment in Ocugen Inc underscores a strategic positioning to capitalize on future biotechnological advancements. While the current financial health of Ocugen presents certain risks, the potential for significant returns exists, aligning with State Street Corp's broader investment strategy. As the biotech landscape evolves, this move could prove to be a pivotal part of State Street Corp's portfolio, depending on Ocugen's clinical and commercial success.

2024-10-16T18:56:39+00:00,Amazon is joining Google and Microsoft in going big on nuclear power,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/amazon-joining-google-microsoft-going-160500207.html,"Amazon is joining Google and Microsoft in going big on nuclear power

Amazon (AMZN) is joining its artificial intelligence competitors in the race for nuclear energy.

The tech giant has signed three agreements “to support the development of nuclear energy projects,” it said Wednesday. The agreements include building “several” small modular reactors (SMRs). These “advanced” nuclear reactors have “a smaller physical footprint, allowing them to be built closer to the grid,” Amazon said. And compared with traditional reactors, SMRs can be put online faster because construction takes less time.

“Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040,” Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, said in a statement.

Garman said the investment in nuclear energy is “an important area of investment for Amazon,” because it is “both carbon-free and able to scale.”

Amazon’s agreement with Washington-based Energy Northwest will produce four advanced SMRs that will be built, owned, and operated by the utilities consortium. The tech giant is also investing in SMR reactors and fuel developer X-energy, it said. X-energy’s design for advanced nuclear reactors will be used for Amazon’s project with Energy Northwest.

Under Amazon’s agreement with Virginia-based Dominion Energy (D), the companies will develop an SMR near the utility company’s North Anna Nuclear Generating Station.

While the AI boom has boosted revenues for major tech companies, the technology’s massive demand for energy is hindering climate change efforts.

One query on ChatGPT needs almost 10 times as much electricity as a Google (GOOGL) search, according to a study by Goldman Sachs (GS). In April, Ami Badani, chief marketing officer of British chip designer Arm (ARM), said data centers powering AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT account for 2% of global electricity consumption. That demand, Badani said, could eventually slow down AI progress.

In July, Google said its carbon emissions have risen by 48% since 2019, mostly due to energy consumption by data centers and supply chain emissions. The company’s carbon emissions were up 13% year over year in 2023, according to its 2024 Environmental Report.

In the report, Google said it was “no longer maintaining operational carbon neutrality” and would turn to other “carbon solutions and partnerships” to reach its 2021 goal of reaching net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030.

In 2020, Microsoft (MSFT) set a similar goal to be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade. But in May, the company said its carbon emissions were almost 31% higher than in 2020, according to its 2024 Environmental Sustainability Report. That jump was mostly due to building data centers for AI, Microsoft said, as well as due to AI hardware such as semiconductors and servers.

“Our challenges are in part unique to our position as a leading cloud supplier that is expanding its datacenters,” Microsoft said in a statement. “But, even more, we reflect the challenges the world must overcome to develop and use greener concrete, steel, fuels, and chips.”

Data centers, which are in demand as companies continue developing larger, more powerful models, could consume up to 9% of electricity in the U.S. by 2030 — more than double what is being used now, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

Tech giants are taking notice of their growing carbon footprints.

In July, the Wall Street Journal (NWS) reported that a third of the U.S.’s nuclear power plants were discussing deals with tech companies to supply electricity for data centers.

Among them was Amazon, which was reportedly closing in on a deal to use electricity from Constellation Energy (CEG) — the owner of most of the country’s power plants.

In Amazon’s announcement Wednesday, it said it had made an agreement with Talen Energy “to co-locate a data center facility next to” the company’s Pennsylvania-based nuclear facility.

Earlier this week, Google announced it had signed “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy” from SMRs developed by California-based Kairos Power.

Google said it expects to bring Kairos Power’s first SMR online by the end of the decade. Other reactors will be deployed through 2035. Through the deal, 500 megawatts (MW) of 24/7 carbon-free power will be available to U.S. electricity grids.

In September, Microsoft and Constellation announced a 20-year power purchase agreement that would restart the Unit 1 reactor on Three Mile Island — close to the site of one of the worst nuclear power plant accidents ever in the U.S. Through the deal, which will launch the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC), Microsoft will purchase energy from the Unit 1 reactor as part of its sustainability goal.

The CCEC, which is expected to come online by 2028, will add more than 800 MW of carbon-free electricity to the power grid, a study by the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council found.

Amazon and other tech giants have announced plans to invest in nuclear power to help meet rising demands for clean energy. (Paul Kuroda / For The Times)

Amazon on Wednesday announced plans to invest in nuclear power production to fuel its data centers with clean energy, a key part of the e-commerce giant's push to expand AI-powered services.

""Nuclear energy is safe, reliable, and can help meet the energy needs of our customers for decades to come,"" said Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services' vice president of global data centers in a statement. The company has a goal to achieve net-zero carbon — where the amount of greenhouse gases produced equals the amount removed from the atmosphere — across its operations by 2040.

Amazon is the latest tech giant to turn to nuclear power as a source of clean energy as the demand for more power in data centers grows. Earlier this week, Google announced its partnership with California-based Kairos Power, in which Google plans to buy power produced from small nuclear reactors built by Kairos. The first reactor is scheduled to be running by 2030.

And last month Microsoft announced an agreement with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, in which the facility would be brought back online to produce energy for Microsoft.

Amazon is partnering with Dominion Energy Virginia, Energy Northwest and Talen Energy to explore new efforts to advance nuclear energy, including the development of smaller and faster nuclear reactors. The company is also investing in Maryland-based X-Energy Reactor Company, which announced on Wednesday it's raised $500 million in financing.

Robert Blue, chair, president and chief executive of Dominion Energy, called the partnership an ""important step forward"" that would fuel the development of ""carbon-free power generation in Virginia,"" according to a news release from the company.

The partnerships come as tech companies face more demands for electricity because of the race to build more AI services that can generate text, images and other content. Tech giants, which already invest in solar and wind technologies, are searching for new sources of clean energy amid growing pressure to limit the greenhouse gas emissions they produce as they expand their AI products. These gasses trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to rising temperatures.

A query on OpenAI's ChatGPT, on average, requires nearly 10 times as much electricity to process as a Google search, according to Goldman Sachs. Analysts for the firm estimate that the power needed to run data centers, where large-scale computing operations are done to support a variety of tech services, will grow 160% by 2030.

Total electricity consumption of data centers could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026, more than doubling the usage in 2022, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency.

Amazon's announcement drew praise from lawmakers and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm as the United States pursues a goal of being completely dependent on clean electricity by 2035.

In July, Amazon said it hit its goal of powering its global operations, including its data centers, with 100% renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of its target of 2030.

2024-10-16T18:17:22+00:00,"Why Cameco, Denison Mines, and Energy Fuels Stocks All Popped on Wednesday",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-cameco-denison-mines-energy-181722746.html,"Uranium mining stocks surged higher on Wednesday, with industry bellwether Cameco (NYSE: CCJ) rising 8.2% through 2:11 p.m. ET, Denison Mines (NYSEMKT: DNN) doing even better with a 14.7% gain, and smaller Energy Fuels (NYSEMKT: UUUU) performing best of all -- up 17%.

Investors are betting on a resurgence in demand for nuclear energy, and their optimism is not without reason as tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) are placing multibillion-dollar bets on the sector.

What's going on with nuclear power?

Last month, Microsoft ignited the rally in nuclear stocks when it signed a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG) under which the latter will reopen Unit 1 of its Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. Microsoft needs extra power to run the servers at its Azure business unit, and thinks nuclear might be the best way to produce that power in a carbon-free way.

Momentum in the sector picked up this week with announcements from first Alphabet and then Amazon that they, too, are looking to nuclear energy to power their data centers.

Alphabet's Google business is partnering with privately held Kairos Power to open a series of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Totaling only 500 megawatts (MW) in power production capacity, the Google news is only half as big as Microsoft's. (Full-scale nuclear power plants generally generate power in the gigawatt range). But that's not why the Google news is significant. It's backing an entirely new kind of nuclear power plants -- SMRs, which are expected to be both cheaper and faster to build than traditional plants.

In theory, that could drive demand for nuclear energy -- and for uranium to fuel it -- faster than simply building more gigawatt-scale power plants would do. It's this prospect that lies behind the strong interest in uranium producer stocks Wednesday.

Enthusiasm only grew greater Wednesday morning when Amazon announced plans to partner with Energy Northwest, Dominion Energy (NYSE: D), and privately held X-energy to build four SMRs in the state of Washington and at least one in Virginia. Combined, these projects promise to bring at least 620 megawatts of nuclear power online -- and potentially more than 1 gigawatt, equivalent to a full-scale nuclear power plant.

Should you buy uranium stocks now?

But should you be buying uranium stocks in the middle of a uranium stock-buying frenzy? While I'm bullish on the prospects for the nuclear power industry in general and am finding validation for that bullishness in all this recent news, I still think the answer to this question is ... maybe, but tread carefully and watch the valuations.

With a market cap of less than $2 billion even after this latest share price surge, Denison Mines is arguably the cheapest of these three stocks, trading at ""only"" 47 times trailing earnings. Denison also has no debt on its balance sheet, and $93 million in cash -- which is good news, because it will need it. It's currently burning cash at the rate of $28 million a year, and isn't expected to turn free cash flow positive until 2028, according to the analysts who follow it. Cameco is a horse of a different color. Valued at more than $24 billion currently, it is easily the most valuable stock in this sector. On the other hand, it trades at a staggering 129 times trailing earnings. Cameco is both profitable and free cash flow positive, and analysts expect its profits to roughly triple over the next five years. Still, with a valuation that's 27.5 times its forecast earnings in 2028, it's hard to call the stock cheap. And Energy Fuels? With a $1.3 billion market cap, Energy Fuels is only a little less expensive than Denison. Analysts hope Energy Fuels turns profitable next year, and begins generating free cash flow in 2027. It's unprofitable today, however, and in its 25-year history, it hasn't ever generated positive free cash flow. While Energy Fuels stock looks speculative to me, it possesses cash reserves that should be sufficient to last until its free cash flow turns positive. In a momentum-driven market where none of these stocks looks cheap by the traditional valuation metrics of price to earnings, or price to free cash flow, tiny Energy Fuels might turn out to be the best performer of all.

The investor, 60 and from Canada, said he planned to retire in two years. Asked why two years, since his dividend income was enough to retire immediately, the investor responded:

""It takes time to close down a practice (MD) and my youngest is still in University, so that's a last major expense.""

Someone asked him for advice or tips. Here's what he said:

""Basically just dca every month 15% of income. (I) didn't really start making over 150,000 a year until 34 years old. So almost all of this has accumulated over the last 25 years. I should have pivoted to dividends earlier as many of my non dividend tech stocks have crashed hard.""

The investor said he made about $200,000 after taxes. Answering a question about how many years he'd been accumulating wealth, he said:

""30. I have paid off my house, rec property and three cars.""

Let's look at some of the biggest holdings in the portfolio.

Vanguard FTSE Canadian High Dividend Yield Index ETF exposes investors to some of the top high-yield Canadian dividend stocks. It tracks the FTSE Canada High Dividend Yield Index. Royal Bank of Canada (RY), Enbridge (ENB) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) are among the fund’s top holdings. This was the biggest holding of the Redditor, earning over $9,000 per month in dividends, accounting for about 8.5% of the total portfolio. With a dividend yield of 6.6%, Canadian energy infrastructure company Enbridge Inc. (ENB.TO) was the second biggest holding of the Redditor, earning about $9,000 per month in dividends. The stock accounted for about 6.7% of the $3.6 million portfolio. The company has consistently raised its dividends for about three decades now. Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. (BAM.TO) is a Canadian alternative investment management company that focuses on real estate, renewable power, infrastructure, credit and private equity. About 5.8% of the total portfolio of the Redditor making $9,000 per month in dividends was allocated to this company. BAM.TO has a dividend yield of about 3.3%. Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ.TO) was the fourth-biggest holding of Redditor, making $9,000 in dividends a month. The stock offers a dividend yield of over 4% and the company has consistently raised dividends for 24 straight years. About 5.1% of the $3.6 million portfolio of Redditor was allocated to CNQ. Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) is another top high-yield dividend stock in the investor’s portfolio, raking in over $9,000 per month in dividends. The portfolio screenshots shared by the Redditor publicly showed BMO accounted for 4.5% of the total portfolio. The stock is up 14% over the past year.

The Canadian investor earning over $9,000 monthly had about 4.1% of his total $3.6 million portfolio invested in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE:SCHD). The ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and exposes you to some of the top dividend stocks trading in the U.S., including Home Depot, Coca-Cola, Verizon, Lockheed Martin, Pepsi and AbbVie, among many others. Since SCHD's holdings are mostly conservative dividend payers, it's suitable for investors close to retirement looking for consistent dividend income. However, the investor noted a caveat of investing in SCHD for Canadian investors during the discussion: ""But the real issue with JEPI SCHD and similar is that if you hold them in Canada, you get 15% less dividend and are taxed differently on non-Canadian dividend products. If you are in the U.S., it's more of a no-brainer when you reach retirement."" Canadian natural gas company Tourmaline Oil Corp. (TOU.TO) was among Redditor’s top 10 holdings, earning $9,000 per month in dividends. When asked what stocks he thought were the best for his income portfolio, the investor said TOU stood out because of its special dividends. About 3.4% of Redditor’s portfolio was invested in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company recently raised its quarterly dividend by 10%. It offers a sweet spot between dividend income and capital gains through stock price appreciation. MSFT is up 30% over the past 12 months. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) usually gets attention for its AI chips instead of dividends. However, the company has a strong dividend growth track record, having raised its annual dividend for 13 consecutive years. AVGO has a dividend yield of 1.2%.

2024-10-16T17:12:00+00:00,Can Rubrik Stock Benefit From Enhanced Data Security in Microsoft 365?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rubrik-stock-benefit-enhanced-data-171200363.html,"Rubrik RBRK on Tuesday launched its Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) solution for Microsoft MSFT 365 Copilot, aimed at enhancing data security and governance as organizations increasingly adopt AI-powered tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot. 



With the growing volume of sensitive data stored in Microsoft 365 environments, Rubrik’s DSPM provides crucial visibility and control, helping organizations manage data classification, labeling, and access permissions. 



The solution is designed to minimize privacy risks and ensure that sensitive information remains protected from unauthorized access, allowing organizations to confidently and securely leverage the full potential of Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Rubrik’s growing customer base and increased demand for its data security solutions have been a major growth driver.

Rubrik, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Rubrik, Inc. Quote

In second-quarter fiscal 2025, subscription revenues surged 50% year over year to reach $191.3 million, fueled by strong momentum from a robust partner network and the growing adoption of its solutions.



RBRK’s subscription Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) reached $919 million, marking 40% year-over-year growth in second-quarter fiscal 2025. The upside can be attributed to adding new customers and expanding relationships with existing ones.

Rubrik’s expanding clientele, which includes major industry players like Pure Storage PSTG, Alphabet’s GOOGL cloud business, Google Cloud and CrowdStrike, has been a key catalyst.



In September, Rubrik partnered with Pure Storage to enhance Cyber Resilience through a three-layered defense strategy that combines primary storage, data security and long-term retention using Rubrik Security Cloud.



In August, the company announced a partnership with Mandiant, a division of Alphabet’s Google Cloud, aimed at integrating threat intelligence and improving cyber recovery capabilities to bolster organizations’ defenses against data breaches and ransomware attacks.



Rubrik’s expansion in cloud services has been noteworthy. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company achieved $678 million in cloud ARR, which is an 80% year-over-year increase. RBRK’s ability to deliver cloud-native solutions played a vital role in its overall growth, positioning it as a leader in the data management and security space.

Despite Rubrik’s strong demand for its data security solutions and growing client base, intense competition in the cyber resilience market and macroeconomic challenges are expected to impact RBRK’s top-line growth in fiscal 2025.



Rubrik shares have risen 5.7% in the year-to-date period compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 26.8% and the Zacks Internet - Software sector’s rise of 26.3%.



For third-quarter fiscal 2025, RBRK expects revenues between $216.5 million and $218.5 million. Non-GAAP loss is expected to be between 40 cents and 46 cents per share.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues is currently pegged at $217.64 million. The consensus mark for loss is currently pegged at 40 cents per share, unchanged in the past 30 days.",MSFT,yes,eod,635
2024-10-16T17:07:12+00:00,State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Paramount Global Shares,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corps-strategic-acquisition-170712925.html,"State Street Corp, a prominent investment firm, recently expanded its portfolio by acquiring an additional 6,850,073 shares of Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) at a price of $10.62 per share. This transaction, dated September 30, 2024, increased State Street Corp's total holdings in Paramount to 44,156,063 shares, marking a significant endorsement of the media giant despite its current market challenges.

Based in Boston, MA, State Street Corp is not just a financial entity but a powerhouse in investment management. The firm's philosophy focuses on diversified, long-term investment strategies. With a portfolio that includes top holdings like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), State Street Corp is a major player in the technology and financial services sectors, managing an equity portfolio worth approximately $2,285.63 trillion.

Paramount Global operates across various segments including TV media, filmed entertainment, and direct-to-consumer platforms like Paramount+. Despite a robust portfolio of assets, the company faces significant market challenges, reflected by a current stock price of $10.57, closely trailing the recent transaction price. Paramount's valuation metrics suggest caution, labeled as a possible value trap with a GF Value of $18.87, indicating the stock might be overvalued at current levels.

Paramount Global shows a complex financial picture with a PE Ratio of 0, indicating losses, and a GF Score of 71, suggesting average performance potential. The stock has seen a year-to-date decline of 26.6%, with profitability and growth ranks at 7 and 3 out of 10, respectively. These figures highlight the challenges Paramount faces in a competitive media landscape.

The acquisition of Paramount shares increases State Street Corp's stake in the media sector, with these shares constituting a minor 0.02% of its vast portfolio. This move could be seen as a strategic diversification, or potentially a value play, assuming Paramount can navigate its current challenges effectively.

State Street Corp's investment might influence other investors' perceptions of Paramount Global, potentially stabilizing the stock or preparing the ground for a strategic turnaround. As market watchers evaluate this move, it could lead to a reassessment of risk and potential in the media-diversified sector.

State Street Corp's recent investment in Paramount Global represents a calculated addition to its expansive portfolio. While the immediate financial impact appears minimal, the long-term implications could be more significant, depending on Paramount's operational success and market conditions. This move by State Street Corp could signal a broader strategy of leveraging undervalued assets in volatile sectors, aligning with its reputation for strategic, diversified investments.

This transaction, executed at a price of $13.54 per share, reflects a strategic move by the firm to bolster its holdings in the energy and agribusiness sectors. Despite the substantial number of shares acquired, the impact on State Street Corps overall portfolio remains minimal, with the position representing only 6.10% of their total holdings in the stock.

State Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a global leader in asset management and banking services. With a vast portfolio of over 4,172 stocks, the firm is heavily invested in technology and financial services, holding major stakes in industry giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). State Street Corp's investment philosophy focuses on diversified global exposure and strategic sector investments, aiming to deliver substantial returns to its stakeholders.

Green Plains Inc, listed under the symbol GPRE, operates within the chemicals industry in the United States. Since its IPO on March 15, 2006, the company has focused on the production and sale of ethanol and related byproducts through its multiple business segments, including ethanol production and agribusiness and energy services.

Financial and Market Analysis of Green Plains Inc

Green Plains Inc's financial health shows mixed signals; the firm holds a Profitability Rank of 4/10 and a Growth Rank of 2/10, indicating challenges in these areas. However, its GF Score of 57 suggests a below-average future performance potential. The company's stock has experienced a significant downturn, with a year-to-date price decrease of 52.5%, and a stark decline of 70.55% since its IPO.

Impact of the Trade on State Street Corps Portfolio

The recent acquisition of Green Plains Inc shares by State Street Corp, although substantial in volume, represents a strategic diversification rather than a major portfolio shift. This move aligns with State Streets ongoing strategy to invest in sectors with long-term growth potential, including sustainable and renewable resources, which are becoming increasingly important in todays market.

State Street Corps investment in Green Plains Inc fits into a broader strategy of enhancing its presence in the technology and financial services sectors while also tapping into the renewable energy market. This sector is expected to grow due to increasing environmental awareness and regulatory support for sustainable practices. When compared to its industry peers, Green Plains Inc shows a competitive edge in innovation and market niche, but it lags in financial robustness and growth metrics. This positioning might have influenced State Street Corps decision to invest, seeing potential for turnaround or undervalued assets. The strategic acquisition of Green Plains Inc shares by State Street Corp could be indicative of the firms confidence in the renewable resources markets growth. Looking forward, the performance of Green Plains Inc will be crucial in determining the success of this investment, especially in a fluctuating economic and regulatory environment.

2024-10-16T16:07:05+00:00,"Amazon signs nuclear power deals, following Google, Microsoft",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-signs-nuclear-power-deals-160705657.html,"Amazon on Wednesday said it has signed three agreements to develop nuclear power projects, making the e-commerce giant the latest Big Tech firm to announce nuclear deals in recent weeks amid a surge in demand for energy to power artificial intelligence.

The company inked deals with public utility conglomerate Energy Northwest and developer X-Energy to build several small modular reactors (SMRs) in the region, and made an agreement with Dominion Energy in Virginia to explore the development of another SMR to boost power in that area.

""Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040,"" Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman said in a statement announcing the deals.

""One of the fastest ways to address climate change is by transitioning our society to carbon-free energy sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon-free and able to scale— which is why it’s an important area of investment for Amazon,"" Garman continued. ""Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.""

Amazon is the second major U.S. tech firm to announce investments in nuclear power this week, after Google on Monday said it signed a deal with Kairos Power to bring Kairos' first small modular reactor online by 2030, followed by additional deployments through 2035.

""We feel like nuclear can play an important role in helping to meet our demand... cleanly in a way that's more around the clock,"" Michael Terrell, senior director for energy and climate at Google, told reporters on a call.

Technology firms have signed several recent agreements with nuclear power companies this year as artificial intelligence boosts power demand for the first time in decades.

Nuclear Energy Is The Answer To Powering Ai Data Centers: Kyle Wool

In March, Amazon purchased a nuclear-powered datacenter from Talen Energy. Last month, Microsoft and Constellation Energy signed a power deal to help resurrect a unit of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst U.S. nuclear accident in 1979.

U.S. data center power use is expected to roughly triple between 2023 and 2030 and will require about 47 gigawatts of new generation capacity, according to Goldman Sachs estimates, which assumed natural gas, wind and solar power would fill the gap.",MSFT,yes,eod,485

The idea that you can't beat the broader market and see your capital grow by sticking to dividend stocks is becoming outdated. With major tech companies like Meta Platforms, Salesforce and Alphabet, among many others, joining the growing ranks of dividend-paying growth stocks, the opportunities for investors looking for both dividend income and stock price appreciation are expanding.

About a year ago, a dividend investor on Reddit shared his success story, saying he was making over $10,000 in passive income and beating the S&P 500 by investing in dividend stocks. He shared screenshots of his investing portfolio, showing his annual income at about $11,800 a year or $991 per month.

When asked how much he had invested, the Redditor said his total value was $200,000. Since the investor had highlighted in his post that he was feeling ""doubly awesome"" by making significant dividend income and beating the market, someone asked him whether he had beaten the market for just one year.

2024-10-16T15:23:00+00:00,2 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-millionaire-maker-technology-stocks-152300887.html,"The tech sector is known for its volatile market action and tendency to deliver strong long-term returns. There are also many failed growth stories and burned-out trends along the way, but the big winners have more than made up for those disappointments. Industry giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have made lots of millionaires over the last four decades, and now investors are looking for the next game-changing champion in the same mold.

I'm here to show you a couple of tech stocks that could fill that promise in the long run. A modest investment in MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) or Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) could make you millions over the next couple of decades.

Neither one of these companies will have an easy path to that wealth-building future, of course. There are economic challenges and hungry rivals everywhere, and many things can go wrong. But if they play their cards right, these stocks are poised for market-beating returns and decades of shareholder-friendly success.

So the two names mentioned above are some of my favorite tech stocks to buy today and hold for the long haul. Here's how.

It's no secret that an investment in MicroStrategy is a pretty direct bet on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).

The company owns more of the largest digital currency than almost any other company, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. The only exception is the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT), which is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF on the market. MicroStrategy has bought 252,220 Bitcoins so far, and keeps adding to that total every time chairman Michael Saylor can get his hands on some more cash.

That may not sound like much of a tech stock at first blush. However, Saylor and MicroStrategy have been around for decades, building a respectable suite of enterprise-class data analytics tools. Right now, the aggressive Bitcoin strategy could lay the foundation for epic long-term growth in the software business.

If Saylor's rosy analysis of Bitcoin's future pricing prospects turns out to be correct -- or at least in the right ballpark -- MicroStrategy would soon have a cash reserve rivaling that of Apple or Microsoft. Saylor's lofty price target of $13 million per coin by 2045 would make the company's current Bitcoin reserves worth nearly $3.3 trillion, not counting any additional Bitcoin buys. Not even Apple can compete with that financial platform today.

In the tech sector, deep pockets can buy you top-notch engineers and expensive innovation projects. So MicroStrategy is a Bitcoin play today, potentially evolving into a software giant in the long run.

Cord-cutting isn't a new trend, but it's here to stay. Media-streaming services are taking over the entertainment industry from the old cable, satellite, and broadcast platforms. Roku was one of the first players on the hardware and software side of this compelling growth story, and remains a leader today. A recent Pixalate report shows that Roku-powered devices hold a 48% share of the connected devices market in North America. And if you think Roku will run out of growth prospects as the U.S. and Canada media markets become saturated with digital streaming platforms -- think again. It's a big world out there and Roku has barely started to explore the foreign business prospects. Checking up on Roku's financial filings, you'll find that international markets have never produced more than 10% of Roku's total revenues in any given year. In other words, the greenfield growth opportunity is massive. The lessons learned in North America should help Roku conquer the digital media world at large. That has turned out to be a plan of game-changing effectivity in the past. If you invested $4,000 in Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) 20 years ago, you'd have more than $1.1 million today. Roku is exploring a similar international growth avenue, and is only getting started. At the same time, bears are focused on weak digital advertising sales in recent years, and Roku's stock is trading at the bargain-bin valuation ratio of 2.9 times sales. The low price makes it easier to build a Roku position of game-changing proportions. I'm not saying that $4,000 invested in Roku today will make you a million dollars by 2044, but any reasonable combination of a solid starting investment and many years of stoic patience should do the job. Long story short, Roku is my favorite stock to buy in the fall of 2024.

This collaboration will improve software compatibility across their x86-based chips in response to escalating performance of ARM holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) that erode the market share of both companies.

The x86 architecture is the dominant computing architecture used in laptops, PCs, and data center servers. Intel invented it, and AMD licensed it. Then suddenly ARM came with its computing architecture and presented a competition to both companies by successfully partnering with important clients like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG).

ARM has gained market share due to its energy efficiency and software compatibility. Intel and AMD can't just sit back and watch, they need to do something.

Intel and AMD decided to team up and improve their quality by addressing the same issue they face: compatibility. Intel and AMD use the same x86 architecture but their chips may require software tweaks to work seamlessly together. So, to address this issue, Intel and AMD made an advisory group that consists of leading industry players such as Broadcom, Dell Technologies, Lenovo Group, and Oracle to ensure consistency and compatibility across their chips. So the plan is: Intel and AMD will improve their compatibility and the advisory group will give them feedback.

Recently, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger stressed that x86 remains very active in the modern world of computing and has great potential for its development in the context of AI. He further stated that scalability has been a unique selling proposition of the architecture stating that x86 still has serious prospects of further advancement.

ARM Holdings has significantly impacted the semiconductor industry, particularly in the mobile and embedded markets by its architecture that has eroded the market share of traditional x86 giants like Intel and AMD. Here's why:
• Energy Efficiency: Energy efficiency is the power that ARM possesses that Intel and AMD have struggled with. The architecture is ideal for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets and has high compatibility for embedded systems like IoT devices like smartwatches, and automotive electronics.
• Licensing Model: AMR's licensing model provides broader flexibility for the clients compared to the traditional way of purchasing chips from Intel or AMD.
• Ecosystem and Software: ARM's architecture gains support from the open-source communities as they build a robust ecosystem that attracts developers and encourages the creation of applications and solutions specifically for ARM-based platforms. So the support not only comes from the employees but also from the technology community they built.
• Market Penetration: After successfully penetrating the mobile device market, ARM expanded to other markets like data centers and servers too.

2024-10-16T14:21:00+00:00,Microsoft Unveils Healthcare AI Innovations: Risky Bet for Investors?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-unveils-healthcare-ai-innovations-142100221.html,"In a bold move that could reshape the healthcare technology landscape, Microsoft MSFT recently announced a suite of artificial intelligence innovations aimed at transforming patient care and clinical workflows. The tech giant's latest offerings, unveiled as part of its Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare platform, represent a significant push into the lucrative yet complex healthcare market.



For investors, Microsoft's push into healthcare AI represents both an opportunity and a challenge. On the one hand, the global digital health market is projected to grow significantly in the coming years, offering substantial revenue potential. On the other hand, the development and deployment of these technologies require significant investment, and returns may not be immediate.



Microsoft's comprehensive approach could position it as a leader in the global healthcare AI market, which was valued at $19.27 billion in 2023 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 38.5% from 2024 to 2030, per a Grand View Research report.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microsoft’s 2024 revenues is pegged at $277.4 billion, which suggests 13.17% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $13.02 per share, which implies a 10.34% increase.

At the heart of these innovations are new healthcare AI models in Azure AI Studio, designed to integrate and analyze diverse medical data types, including imaging and genomics. Developed in collaboration with industry partners like Providence and Paige.ai, these models aim to accelerate the deployment of AI solutions in healthcare organizations. While the potential for improved diagnostics and research is clear, investors should note that the healthcare AI market is becoming increasingly competitive, with rivals like Google and Amazon also vying for dominance.



Microsoft is also tackling the perennial challenge of healthcare data management with its Microsoft Fabric platform. By offering tools for data integration, governance, and analytics, the company is positioning itself as a central player in the healthcare data ecosystem. However, the sensitive nature of medical information and the stringent regulatory environment could pose significant risks and challenges to widespread adoption.



Perhaps the most intriguing development is the public preview of the healthcare agent service in Copilot Studio. This AI-powered tool, designed to assist with tasks like appointment scheduling and patient triaging, directly addresses the pressing issues of workforce shortages and rising costs in healthcare. Early adopters like Cleveland Clinic are already implementing these solutions but the long-term impact on healthcare operations and potential regulatory hurdles remain uncertain.



Microsoft's collaboration with Epic to develop AI solutions for nursing documentation is another noteworthy initiative. With the World Health Organization predicting a global shortage of 4.5 million nurses by 2030, this technology could prove invaluable. However, the success of this venture will largely depend on user acceptance and the ability to integrate with existing healthcare systems seamlessly.

While these innovations demonstrate Microsoft's commitment to healthcare AI, investors should approach the stock with caution. The healthcare sector is complex, with stringent regulations and slow adoption rates for new technologies. Moreover, concerns about data privacy, AI bias and the potential for errors in critical care settings could pose significant reputational and financial risks. If Microsoft can successfully navigate these challenges, the potential rewards are substantial. 



Moreover, the success of these innovations hinges on their adoption by healthcare providers, many of whom may be hesitant to integrate new technologies into their established workflows. The effectiveness of these AI tools in real-world healthcare settings remains to be seen, and widespread adoption could take years.



With an 11.4% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Microsoft has underperformed both the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500 index’s return of 24.9% and 22%, respectively. This raises a crucial question of whether Microsoft's AI advancements will provide the needed boost to its stock performance. The AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with tech giants like Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, NVIDIA NVDA and Oracle ORCL making significant investments in the healthcare sector. Microsoft's success will hinge on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and effectively monetize its AI technologies. Additionally, looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to the AI-driven growth prospects of the industry.



Microsoft's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month P/S ratio of 10.79X exceeding both the Zacks Computer - Software industry average of 7.67X and its own historical median of 10.15X. This elevated pricing reflects strong investor confidence in Microsoft's future growth, particularly in cloud computing and AI. However, it also raises questions about potential limitations and whether the company's performance can justify this premium in the long term.



As Microsoft navigates these challenges, investors will be closely watching its ability to translate AI innovations into tangible financial results and market outperformance. While Microsoft's foray into healthcare AI showcases innovative potential, it presents a double-edged sword for investors. The complex regulatory landscape, slow adoption rates in healthcare, and significant upfront investments make this a potentially risky bet, demanding careful consideration and a long-term perspective from those looking to capitalize on Microsoft's ambitious healthcare strategy. New investors should wait for a better entry point for Microsoft, which currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2024-10-16T08:48:32+00:00,Automation Software Stocks Q2 Highlights: Appian (NASDAQ:APPN),https://finance.yahoo.com/news/automation-software-stocks-q2-highlights-084832461.html,"Quarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company’s progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Appian (NASDAQ:APPN) and the best and worst performers in the automation software industry.

The whole purpose of software is to automate tasks to increase productivity. Today, innovative new software techniques, often involving AI and machine learning, are finally allowing automation that has graduated from simple one- or two-step workflows to more complex processes integral to enterprises. The result is surging demand for modern automation software.

The 6 automation software stocks we track reported a strong Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.8% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line.

Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled.

Thankfully, automation software stocks have been resilient with share prices up 5.4% on average since the latest earnings results.

Founded by Matt Calkins and his three friends out of an apartment in Northern Virginia, Appian (NASDAQ:APPN) sells a software platform that lets its users build applications without using much code, allowing them to create new software more quickly.

Appian reported revenues of $146.5 million, up 14.7% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.5%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a slower quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ billings estimates and a decline in its gross margin.

“Due to enhanced functionality launched this quarter, Appian AI usage nearly doubled,” said Matt Calkins, CEO & Founder.

Appian delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 16.6% since reporting and currently trades at $30.85.

Founded by Alan Trefler in 1983, Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) offers a software-as-a-service platform to automate and optimize workflows in customer service and engagement.

Pegasystems reported revenues of $351.2 million, up 17.7% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 8.1%. The business had an exceptional quarter with a solid beat of analysts’ billings estimates and an improvement in its gross margin. Pegasystems delivered the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 20.2% since reporting. It currently trades at $73.52.

Founded in 2002 by Zach Halmstad and Chip Pearson, right around the time when Apple began to dominate the personal computing market, Jamf (NASDAQ:JAMF) provides software for companies to manage Apple devices such as Macs, iPads, and iPhones. Jamf reported revenues of $153 million, up 13.3% year on year, in line with analysts’ expectations. Still, it was a a satisfactory quarter as it posted full-year revenue guidance exceeding analysts’ expectations. The stock is flat since the results and currently trades at $16.45. Read our full analysis of Jamf’s results here. Short for microcomputer software, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the largest software vendor in the world with its Windows operating system, Office suite, and cloud computing services. Microsoft reported revenues of $64.73 billion, up 15.2% year on year. This number was in line with analysts’ expectations. It was a satisfactory quarter: Revenue roughly met expectations, but all-import Azure constant-currency revenue growth missed. Microsoft had the weakest performance against analyst estimates among its peers. The stock is flat since reporting and currently trades at $419.20.

Founded by Fred Luddy, who wrote the code for the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a software-as-a-service platform that helps companies become more efficient by allowing them to automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service. ServiceNow reported revenues of $2.63 billion, up 22.2% year on year. This number met analysts’ expectations.
